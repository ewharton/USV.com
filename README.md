# What is this?

This is an analysis of [USV.com](https://www.USV.com) post data from inception to Feb 2015. For a few years, USV.com was my favorite place to hang out on the internet. There was once a section on the website called "Conversation". It looked like this:

Any user could submit links to an article. The community would comment and upvote them. The links were ranked by comments, upvotes and time submitted. This started as a Hack Day project to understand who was contributing value to the community and topics the community liked to discuss. 

There are three sections: 

**Poster segments**: Identify poster segments, who is in them and how they compare against each other  <br />
**Post Patterns**: Words and topics that are popular with the community, Trends in posting time <br />
**Poster Profiles** Words and topics that specific posters prefer  <br />


I recommend going [here](ewharton.github.io) to view this. It is static HTML with all of the code hidden for easy viewing. If you want the code, then open up USV.com_analysis.ipynb.
