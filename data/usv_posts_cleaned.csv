Union Square Sessions 1 - Peer Production,ceonyc,2005-10-20 10:24:01,0,0,[],"Today we hosted the first of what we hope will be many conversations about the impact of information technology on our society, our economy and on the business of venture capital.   The subject of this ""session"" was peer production. We were blessed by the presence of great group of energetic and experienced, entrepreneurs, investors and analysts who have all been thinking deeply about this stuff for a long time. Our goal, in bringing these folks together was to contribute to and encourage a conversation that is already in full flower in the blogosphere.   We won't  be able to replicate the experiece of being in the room today, but we will do our best to share the thinking by posting a complete transcript. In the meantime, we have posted some pictures of the event.  "

Is Bill Gates the Cat with Nine Lives?,fredwilson,2005-09-28 15:25:26,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Conventional wisdom says tech companies rise and fall with the waves of innovation that lash the shores of the technology business. There are so many examples of this that I won't bother to repeat them.  But there is one cat out there that has so far avoided that fate.  His name is Bill Gates and his company, Microsoft, is being talked about quite a bit in the blog world and the business rags this week.  Let's go back and look at the three lives that Microsoft has had so far.  PC 1.0 - Bill invented PC 1.0 when he got IBM to adopt his OS (not even sure it was his OS, but we'll leave that one alone) as the standard for the PC platform.  PC 2.0 - Apple created PC 2.0, threatening Microsoft's dominance.  Bill retooled Microsoft to respond to the threat. The result was Windows and Office, the two franchises that even today power most of the Company's revenue and profits.  Web 1.0 - Netscape made the browser mainstream threatening Microsoft's dominance of the desktop.  Now the browser was the place people lived on a computer. Bill went after Netscape with a vengeance, bundled Internet Explorer into the Windows OS, and put Netscape out of business and got himself in trouble with the Feds.  So far, this cat has had three lives.  So now we've got Web 2.0.  Is this cat going to get a fourth life?  That's what inquiring minds want to know.  It's a $280bn question.  Web 2.0 - Google invents the ultimate disruptive free web service with search and shows how it can be monetized like hell with paid search.  Every entrepreneur worth their salt takes the LAMP stack and builds a lighweight web service to try their hand at the same trick.  This isn't cool for Microsoft at all.  So the question is whether Microsoft's response, coming next year in the form of Vista (fka Longhorn) and supplemented with .net, Avalon, Ajax, and a host of other interesting web service oriented technologies, will bring them back to the leadership position they believe belongs to them.  My friend Brad Feld spent a day at PDC and came away saying that 2006 will be the year of Microsoft.  Read his post, because it got me thinking, and it might get you thinking.  Earlier yesterday I had lunch with a friend who predicted that Vista will put a lot of these lightweight web services out of business the way that the Windows/Office juggernaut put a lot of PC software companies out of business in the early 90s and pissed the VCs off mightily.  So some smart people are clearly thinking that this cat has at least four lives.  But I am not so sure.  I didn't go to PDC, I didn't work at Microsoft, I am not ""technical"", but my gut says that we are in a different place now and its going to be much harder for Bill to put this genie back in the bottle.  People ask me why all these smart developers are leaving Microsoft.  I don't think its the ""rats leaving the simking ship"" phenomenon because Microsoft is not a sinking ship and even if it doesn't have nine lives will live a long time on its Windows/Office franchise.  I think its because software is becoming ""organic"". I believe Google started this movement. They released a free web service that people responded to in an emotional way. That created a phenomenon that drew developers and users to the Google franchise. Google opened up their APIs so people could build businesses on top of them. Now they have a whole ecosystem.  This has happened with other software platforms too - Craigslist, Flickr, Skype, etc.  Microsoft may want to be part of this ""organic"" software world, but its not in their DNA.  And I think many of their leading technology minds get this new way of being and want to be part of it.  So they leave, some to Google, many to do startups.  Consumers get this too.  They don't want to be locked in any more.  Microsoft is the master of lock in.  They want open software, open source, open potential.  You don't have to look any farther than Firefox' market share to see this happening in the consumer market.  CIOs might not get this yet.  I think Microsoft's franchise is the CIO going forward because they are risk adverse and are the least likely to move to this new developing organic software model.  But consumers will lead the companies they work for into this world whether they like it or not.  And eventually people will be using wikis and web based email and calendaring apps in their offices and Office will slowly matter less and less.  That's my view.  So does this cat have nine lives?  It depends on the quality of life he's looking for.  I can see an IBM-like scenario for Microsoft in its fourth and possibly fifth life.  But I can't see them at the top of the technology hill planting their flag again for the fourth time next year.  It's just not going to happen that way this time."
"Location, Location, Location",fredwilson,2005-10-03 12:59:16,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Steve Shu's post on VC in different geographies got me thinking.  Steve wrote it on July 28th, but it only showed up in technorati's link search this week so that's when I read it.  I also got a trackback from the people at Qumana who noted that my recent posts on Word of Blog and Posting, Subscribing, and Tagging confirm my interest in what they are doing.  They went on to say that I wasn't interested when they contacted me because they are in Vancouver.  Which is true.  This blog attempts to do a bunch of things, but clearly one of them is to broadcast the things I am interested in investing in to anyone who wants to read that information.  Hopefully I am doing a decent job at that.  One way for me to measure that is looking at the ""yield"" of incoming investment opportunities.  If we measure ""yield"" as the percentage of incoming opportunities that fit our investment strategy, then the ""yield"" is probably 90% or higher.  Charlie can produce an exact percentage if anyone wants it.  So we are seeing a ton of opportunities that are interesting to us.  But then we need to filter them a couple more ways and that's when the ""yield"" drops significantly.  We generally want to be the first venture investor in a company.  We are happy to create a syndicate with other investors and do the deal together, but we generally do not want to come into an investment in the later rounds.  There are a bunch of reasons for this, some economic, but more that relate to our role in the company and our relationship with the entrepreneurs and managers.  But maybe even more important is the role of location which was the subject of this post after all.  Steve Shu says in his post:      VC have historically invested closer to where they are located than farther away [because of deal management and deal sourcing concerns]  Steve is spot on.  The best VCs, which are the ones that can actually help you build a business, have learned that it is a face to face business. And it is very hard to do a face to face business from 3000 miles away.  Some VCs do it and do it well, but I believe that they are the exception that proves the rule.  Here are some concrete examples:  - Board meetings where everyone is face to face are always better than those done over a conference call
- Recruiting senior management to the team often required the involvement of the VC investors.  You can't really help an entrepreneur recruit a team from 3000 miles away.
- The impromptu breakfast, lunch or jamba juice or shake shack run with the entrepreneur never happens from 3000 miles away, but is invaluable in creating the trust and friendship that is critical to the entrepreneur/VC relationship  The fact is that we have a great network here in NY in terms of talent, business development, marketing, etc.   If you are a local company looking to tap into that network, we can really help.  So in the end, VC is like retailing.  Location matters - a lot.  This does not mean that Union Square Ventures won't do a deal outside NY.  We will and are working on several right now.  But it does mean that we won't be able to do everything for our portfolio companies that are outside of NY that we do for the ones that are in NY.  It means we will have to travel more, which is OK, and it also means that we'll probably find like minded VCs who are local to do the deals with us.  So keep the investment opportunities coming even if you are located in Vancouver.  We enjoy meeting entrepreneurs who are working on the opportunities we are interested in.  And if we get really excited about something, we can help find local investors who can do the things that we do with our local investments, and we'll travel more and make the face time that's required.  Another thing this blog attempts to do is educate the entrepreneurs out there who are doing for the first or second time and have yet to learn all the lessons of the VC business.  An important one is location matters when picking your VC.  It's not the only issue, but its an important one."
The Problem with Podcasts,fredwilson,2005-10-03 13:39:41,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I've talked about this before, but I want to say it again.  The problem with podcasts is you can't link to a specific part of the podcast.  You can link to the entire MP3, but if there is a funny joke or a great song, you can't highlight that and take me right to  it.  Last week I was walking to work and listening to the one of the earlier Smoke and Mirrors podcasts which is no longer available online (another problem - need permalinks).  Jackson played a great tune that was apparently lifted from the Expensive Wino sessions at Keith Richards' home in Connecticut and then treated to a superdub. I instantly wanted to blog it, but could not.  Jackson sent me the MP3 and here it is in case there are any Keith Richards/Stones fans out there who want to sample it.  We need the ability to link into a specific point in the podcast and we need good inexpensive hosting services so people can keep their podcasts up forever the way we keep our blog posts up forever.  What's a permalink worth if its not permanent?  I am a fan of podcasting and have even called myself a podhead in a prior post.  I listen to at least five and sometimes as many as ten podcasts a week.  Yet we have not made any of the podcast related investments that have been out there to make.  I guess that even with all my enthusiam for podcasting as a creator of them, a listener of them, and an advocate of them, I still find myself in the camp of David, Jeff, and Russell for now."
Wikis,fredwilson,2005-10-03 13:53:09,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Some things take longer than others for me.  I was quick to grok the blogging thing, reading them, writing them, etc.  I was pretty quick to grok the podcasting and vlogging things too.  RSS made sense to me immediately.  But candidly wikis have taken longer for me.  But I am there now and happy to be at the party.  Better late than never.  I've been using wikipedia for a couple years but its only in the past couple months that I have made it my first stop for any sort of quest for knowledge.   Now when my kids ask me a question while they are doing their homework, whether its something about a proton, Antarctica, or Ben Franklin, I click on the Wikipedia button on my browser and peek into the collective knowledge of the Internet users.  It is fantastic and it gets better and better every day.  Tom Evlsin launched his hackoff.com project over the weekend and called it a ""blook"".  If you go to wikipedia and search for ""blook"", there is already an entry on the topic.  And Tom didn't put it there because he sent me an email telling me how blown away he was to find it there.  The web moves fast and wikipedia is one of its main beneficiaries.  The wiki concept is simple.  Leverage the concept of ""peer production"" to build knowledge bases that could not be economically created any other way.  Wikipedia is clearly the most visible and most powerful example of the power of a wiki, but the wiki movement is taking hold all over the place.  Just this morning, I blogged about Alacra's wiki for business information.  If you know a lot about business information, go there and add some stuff to it.  If you want to know more about business information, go there and benefit from the knowledge of others.  The first people finders I saw in the wake of Katrina were wikis that had been hacked together in a matter of hours.  They got the job done as well or better than many of the other resources that eventually were deployed against that problem.  We used to use a relational database on our server in our office to log every business plan that comes into our firm.  It worked but it was a chore to add new fields or screens.  And you had to be in the office to log into it.  In a day or two several months ago, Charlie hacked together a wiki.  He imported all of the data from our database, and we had a deal log wiki.  But in less than a month, it has expanded to the central resource through which we manage our whole firm.  Why?  Because when we get a business plan or something related to a project we are working on, we just email it to the wiki and its in there the next time we go look at the wiki.  Because when we want to add a screen to capture data on a project or event we are working on, we just add a page and off we go.  And these pages can be shared with whomever we want to share them with.   Because wikis live on the web, not locked in some server in our office, we can choose to open them up, bit by bit, to others we want to collaborate with.  And then we can benefit from the knowledge of others.  Clayton Christensen points out in the Innovator's Dilemma that most disruptive technologies are very simple, easy to use products that lack the power and sophistication of the established category leaders.  But these dead simple tools are adopted quickly because they solve the problems for people in a way that the category leaders don't.  So my experience and my bet is that wikis will take the enterprise by storm.  Because they are simpler, easier, and better.  They are proving it already on the web.  It's just a matter of time before they do it with even more impact in the enterprise.  Here are two places to start if you want to get a wiki  JotSpot - For consumers and small businesses
SocialText - For larger companies."

Downturns,fredwilson,2005-10-03 14:25:12,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"The morning paper this morning is not a pretty picture.  New Orleans is flooded.  Large swaths of the southeast are down and out.  Energy prices are spiking.  The war in Iraq shows no sign of ending anytime soon.  Interest rates are headed up.  The housing boom is showing signs of ending (finally).  We have a federal budget defecit that makes my head ache every time I think of it.  And our trade defecit shows no signs of abating.  Ugly, ugly, ugly.  And yet we've had an abundant supply of capital for early stage businesses for the past several years that has led to the formation of many new companies.  What if that capital supply tightens?  What if we have a recession in 2006 like many economists are now predicting?  What if risk premiums return to normal levels?  These are the questions on my mind this morning.  Fortunately, I've lived through a few downturns in the venture business.  The worst by far was the 2001-2003 downturn which was brought on by the burst of the internet and telecom bubbles and made much worse by 9/11.  But I started in the business in the mid 80s in the midst of the post PC bubble downturn.  And I witnessed the bursting of the biotech bubble of the late 80s/early 90s and saw how hard it was to finance a biotech company in the early 90s.  And even during the Internet boom period from 1996 to 2000, we had a period after the russian debt crisis where capital supplies tightened significantly.  We are surely going to have another of these periods at some point, and given my read of this morning's paper, I am concerned that it might be just around the corner.  So what to do?  First, remember why you made your investments in the first place.  Go back and read the investment memos.  If your thesis remains sound, don't panic.  If you had no thesis and were doing momentum investing, you'll probably have your head handed to you and you deserve it.  Second, talk to your companies. Make sure they have a plan B for their capital needs.   Third, talk to your co-investors.  Make sure they still believe in the company and are going to be supportive.  If all of these factors are postive, then keep your head down and execute.  Deals will take longer to close.  People will become risk adverse.  Plan accordingly.  If you need to slim down, do that.  If you need to put off that big 10 year lease, do that.  In fact, do that no matter what the situation is!  Downturns can be a period of incredible opportunity.   I look at the Flatiron portfolio and the companies that hunkered down and built businesses in the 2001-2003 time period came out of that experience with some amazing businesses.  It takes tenacity, skill, experience, and facing up to hard decisions when the downturn hits.  It is probably a good time to take measure of your company, your team, and your plans to make sure you are prepared for the downturn.  Because its going to come at some point."
Impact Media,fredwilson,2005-10-03 14:26:56,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"For the past 50 years, the media equation has most often been solved for the largest audience.  That is changing and its happening pretty quickly, brought on largely by digital media.  I think the media equation is going to get solved for attention, passion, relevance, and meaning going forward.  I need a good word for the combination of all of those metrics, but for now I am going to use impact.  I often come to these realizations by a series of conversations and this one was brought on by three of them.  The first was a lunch with a friend in the music business.  The second was an email exchange with my high school friend and frequent commenter Tony Alva.  And the third was an extended discussion about video blogging with Heather Green of the terrific Business Week blog called Blogspotting.  At lunch with my friend I heard how record labels have for years focused on radio to market their music and the impact that has had on the kind of music that the labels have chosen to market.  FM radio is a mass medium by virtue of the limited space on the dial.  In most major markets, there are maybe 15 FM radio stations.  Each station tries to build the largest possible audience it can for its chosen format.  The way they do that is by doing research on what the listeners like and dislike.  This research, called ""call out research"" is focused on finding music that will keep the listeners from switching stations.  The result is mainstream, bland music that nobody dislikes enough to switch stations.  The record labels have been so hostage to the radio stations that they have simply given them the bland boring music they want.  And so we have two industries fighting for their lives right now as a result.  Back to my friend in the music business.  He told me that radio is losing its grip on the record labels and music discovery and marketing are moving online.  Kids don't listent to radio anymore to find new music.  Bands don't wait for a record deal and radio to market their music.  The action is on MySpace, iTunes, MP3 blogs, Audioscrobbler, MusicMobs, etc, etc.  Smart record label executives know this and are turning away from the radio formula and embracing the Internet.  But there is no call out research on the Internet.  Instead there are link counts, page views, downloads, and a host of other buzz metrics.  And these buzzmetrics measure impact more than audience size.  The music that is working best on the Internet is not bland and boring.  It inspires hate as much as love.  But it has impact.  That's the future of the record business.  So back to radio.  When I told Tony Alva about the JD Powers report on HD Radio that I posted on yesterday, he said, ""too little, too lae"".  He thinks radio has lost the young listener and will never get it back.  I am not so sure.  And here's what I told Tony.  The radio dial of 2010 is not going to look like the radio dial of 2005.  You've got 100 channels of XM, 100 channels of Sirius, you've got HD FM which will allow as much as 5 channels of programming for each fequency on the dial using multicasting technology, so that makes something like 75 channels of HD FM, and you've got HD AM which will allow music programming due to improved sound quality.  So that's like 300 channels of audio instead of 15.  And the radios will be tri-mode by then and who knows if Satellite will stick to its paid model.  My bet is that we'll see a hybrid model where some of the satellite channels will be free and ad supported and others will be paid.  I suspect the same will be true of the mulitcasted HD FM stations.  So radio will look like cable television, with a huge amount of choice, most free and ad supported, some paid and advertising free.  In that world, my bet is impact will rule and ""call out research"" will be history.  And in that world, the record labels may return to radio to supplement what they are doing online.  On to the video blogging discussion.  Heather is working on a piece on video blogging.  She's done a ton of homework and I think its going to be really good.  I will leave it to her to tell that story.  In thinking about the impact of video blogging with Heather, it struck me that the next big move in cable and satellite TV is for the operators to put RSS subscription services into their set-top boxes and recievers, the way that iTunes just did.  Once they do that, TV viewers will be able to schedule and watch way more than what's in their channel guide.  Among other great stuff, they will be able to subscribe to the delicious funny video feed and be entertained every day by real people.  Talk about reality TV.  And I think the impact of this new form of video entertainment will be huge.  So that's what's been spinning around in my head the past week.  I'd love to hear what you all think about it."
A New Dimension?,fredwilson,2005-10-03 15:00:44,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I feel in my gut that we need a new dimension, a new vector, a new lode to mine.  And I feel that we are close to finding it.   Note the conscious use of the word we in the last sentence.  I am not close to finding it, but we are.  By we, I mean everyone who is working in technology and web services.  Software and web services have been about functionality for the past thirty years.  They help you organize and process the things you need to do.  At this very moment in time, I have six applications open.  Outlook for email.  Outlook for calendaring.  Outlook for contacts.  Word for writing.  Firefox for browsing.  iTunes for listening.  I could have more, but that’s all that I am doing right now.  Each is an island (or a ghetto as a friend of mine says) of automation with efficiency as the ultimate end goal.  Microsoft largely won the “organize and process” era because they offered the most efficient applications using the DOS/Windows operating system as the foundation for delivering efficiency.  There is progress being made connecting these islands of functionality in the browser.  I can write in Firefox (and oh the pain of a browser crash), I can listen in Firefox, I can do email in Firefox, I can do calendaring in Firefox, and so on and so forth.   The browser is replacing the OS.  Big deal, we all know that.  But once that happens, then what?  Many have said that search is the new dimension. Google’s success would certainly suggest that they have found the next lode to mine and are doing a damn good job mining it.  But I think search is just one of the vectors and that the new dimension is relevance.  And search isn’t the ultimate in relevance.  In fact, I think search is a very rudimentary way to deliver relevance.  Many readers have said to me, “Fred, why are you making such noise about the cookie thing?”  Because I believe that relevancy is the next dimension and stored user preferences and data are the foundation of delivering it.  Cookies are one of the ways to do that and I think they are a very important part of the next big thing.  But this is about a lot more than cookies.  It’s about understanding how the next 10-20 years are going to play out in technology and web services.  The Gotham Gal was looking for some stuff for the kids yesterday on the Internet.  She is one of the best Internet shoppers I have ever met. She knows all the best tricks of finding what she wants.  But she said to me that the Internet is getting really crowded these days.  There is so much stuff out there.  Information overload?  No, we were overloaded ten years ago.  What we are today has no word for it because we are too busy checking our non stop email deluge to think of one.  We’ve largely solved the “automate and process” problems.   But we haven’t begun to scratch the surface of the relevancy problem.  So grab your picks and shovels and let’s go mine that lode together."
Indeed,fredwilson,2005-10-03 15:08:04,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Last year, when Brad and I were on the road raising our fund, we used to talk a lot about web services that should exist but don’t.
One of Brad’s favorites was “paid job search.”
Brad would say that job classifieds on the Internet worked like job classifieds in the newspapers, you had to pay for a listing. Then he’d point out that the business model of choice on the Internet was list for free, pay for clicks. And we’d wonder why nobody was doing that.
We did a little research and found out that Flipdog.com had tried it in the heyday of web 1.0 and had a hard time making it work and sold out to Monster.com in the spring of 2001. We looked at what Monster had done with Flipdog and it appeared that they hadn’t done much.
We noticed that there were a few small companies trying to make a go of the paid job search business model but none seemed to be getting much traction. So we just shook our heads and filed it away as something to figure out.
Then in mid December, as we were in the process of closing our fund, I read this post about Indeed on John Batelle's Searchblog. I emailed the link to Brad (we weren’t using delicious back then) and he called Paul Forster, the CEO and co-founder of Indeed.  That begun a seven month courtship that culminated last Friday in an investment by Union Square Ventures into Indeed. Not all of our deals take seven months but Paul and his partner Rony Kahan took a lot of convincing. They had built and sold their last business (another jobs business called Jobsinthemoney) without venture capital and had to be convinced that they should sell a meaningful ownership interest to people they didn’t even know.
I guess we did a pretty good sales job because we got them over that, finally. We were joined in our investment by The New York Times Company and Allen & Company, two top notch organizations that we’ve invested and built companies with before.
To Paul and Rony’s credit, during that seven month courtship, they have built Indeed into the leader in the job search market. Their competitors will probably take exception to that comment, but our analysis of traffic, jobs indexed, and name recognition indicates that Indeed is the leader in pure job search.
So, why did we make this investment, beyond the fact that this was one of the sectors that has always interested us?
For one, we are big believers in the fragmentation of the Internet. We don’t believe that there are going to be several large “destinations” where employers will go to list their jobs in the coming years.
We are a believer in what some of us are calling “sell side advertising”. That’s the idea that advertisers will put their ads on the Internet for anyone to find and display. And if the advertiser gets clicks back, they will pay for the clicks.
Job search is one of the first places that sell-side advertising is going to happen because most employers already put the jobs they are currently looking to fill on their web sites. Those jobs are the “sell side” ads. Indeed and others are crawling the Internet, grabbing those “ads” and displaying them.
It just makes so much sense. Most large employers have HR systems in place which allow managers to automatically post open positions to the web. Those systems then take the incoming applications/resumes they collect on their web sites and process them into the hiring workflow.
In our due diligence, we talked to these employers. They don’t really want to list their jobs in newspapers, job boards, or anywhere other than their website because that’s where they want to collect the resumes. What employers want is the ability to buy traffic to their website, and direct it to the jobs they most want to fill. And they want to buy that traffic on a paid for performance basis, not a fixed price basis.
That what job search does for employers. It’s really simple. Job search delivers traffic to employer’s websites more efficiently than any other method.
The value proposition for job seekers is equally strong. As Indeed says in its tag line “one search. all jobs.”
In the old model, a job seeker needed to scour all the major job boards, the local classifieds, craigslist, and the web sites of the companies they are interested in working for. That is because nobody had a comprehensive list of the open jobs.
Now, it’s much simpler. The job seekers just go to Indeed.com, they do a search, and they get all the jobs that are listed on the Internet, no matter where they are listed.
But on top of that, they get advanced search functionality, the ability to store searches, turn them into RSS feeds, and be alerted when new jobs show up in the index that meet their criteria.
This is a revolution for the job seeker and the traffic growth that Indeed has been seeing since launching in beta last November indicates that job seekers love the idea of job search.
So Indeed has a strong value proposition for both job seekers and employers. That’s critical.
But on top of that, there is something really interesting going on with paid job search. One of the central tenets of Web 2.0 is the notion of syndication of content and commerce. Indeed facilitates that in a big way for the existing job classified providers. Because Indeed and some of the other job search services “play nice”, job boards and other job publishers have been supportive of the efforts of these services.
In fact, one of the leaders in the job board market, Yahoo!/Hotjobs, recently embraced job search in a big way. Yahoo!’s implementation of job search is really interesting. They are backfilling their Hot Jobs service with a job search service that is similar to Indeed’s. It will be interesting to see whether job seekers prefer search results that are filtered exclusively by relevance (Indeed) or by paid/free (as Yahoo! is doing).
But regardless of the business model, the fact that Yahoo!/Hot Jobs is embracing job search means to us that this model is here to stay and is likely to be the front end for most job searches in the future.
It will also be interesting to watch Yahoo! to see if the leaders in traditional web search can do vertical search as well as the companies who are focused exclusively on vertical search. The requirements of job search or travel search or some other form of vertical search require different crawlers, different frequency, different results alogorithms, etc.  So Yahoo!'s entrance into job search is going to be interesting on multiple dimensions.
Another really valuable asset that the job search players own is an index of all the jobs that are available at any time. Indeed keeps jobs in its index for 30 days and currently has over 3.5 million jobs, a figure that is growing daily as new sources are added. That compares to Simply Hired, one of Indeed’s competitors, which keeps jobs in its index for 45 days which boosts their total jobs number. But whatever the policy of keeping jobs in the index, Indeed and Simply Hired have way more jobs available to search than the job boards. The largest job board has less than 500,000 jobs in the latest 30 day period.
Longtime readers know that I have been running an Indeed Jobroll on the right sidebar of this blog for about six months. Anyone can do that by visiting Indeed and doing an advanced search. The results of that search (in my case venture capital and web technology jobs in New York City) will be displayed in a job roll that can be run on any website or blog.
The jobroll is a good example of the way that the Indeed index can be syndicated to provide value to publishers and other operators of web services. In a Web 2.0 world, apps are built on top of apps, and at its core, Indeed is a web service. We look forward to lots of innovation in this area over time.
Like any early stage investment, there are lots of risks and challenges for Indeed and its investors in the coming years. But we are prepared for that because that’s our business.
We are really looking forward to working with Paul and Rony and their team to build the next big thing in the jobs business. Brad is joining the board and will be our point person on the investment, but our style is that every person at Union Square Ventures is involved in every investment and we certainly hope to be a “value added investor” in every sense of the word.
If you are interested in learning more about Indeed, I’d encourage you to go there and do a job search, subscribe to a job search or two with RSS, and put a Indeed job roll on your blog. I think you’ll be as impressed as we have been."
del.icio.us,fredwilson,2005-10-03 15:09:48,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"  I didn't plan on posting anything about Union Square Ventures' most recent investment, del.icio.us.  The founder, Joshua Schachter, posted twice to his list about the investment and I figure that is pretty much the whole story. If you want the details on the investment, that's about all there is to tell.  But I've gotten a number of comments on this blog and elsewhere suggesting that there are people who'd like to hear my side of the story.  So, I'll try to give you that.  del.icio.us is a really interesting web service that lets anyone who uses it ""tag the internet"".  Most people, me included, go there for the first time, look at del.icio.us, and then shake their heads and say ""I don't get it"".  But for those who come back and actually use it, the experience is very different.  del.icio.us becomes a critical tool for them to manage their web experiences.  That's what happened to me.  That's what happened to Brad.  That's what happened to Charlie.  So we figured we ought to pay some attention to del.icio.us.  What we learned when we dug into it is that ""tagging"" is a relatively new, but increasingly important, phenomenon on the web.  Simply put, tagging is the exercise of associating words, any words you want to use, with URLs.  That's all it is - a series of words and URLs. The words are the tags.  But when lots of people start tagging with a similar tool and similar words, and the tags are shared, some very interesting things result.  I like to send people to the del.icio.us tag page to see what that result is.  del.icio.us made tagging popular, but others have used it with incredible results.  The most obvious example is Flickr. I believe that tags and RSS feeds of the tags has made Flickr vastly superior to other photo sharing sites.   RSS feeds make tagging even more powerful.  Because everyone's tag can be an RSS feed, tagging becomes extremely viral and portable.  Jeff Jarvis was the first person that pointed the power of this out to me.  I asked him about del.icio.us and he said that he didn't tag, but he pointed me to this tag that he subscribed to as an RSS feed.  It was like looking at someone's personal daily bookmarks.  That was the aha moment for me.  I would encourage anyone who is curious about tagging to go to del.icio.us, register to create an account, and start tagging.   The most difficult part is getting the posting window into an easy place to use.  I highly recommend the experimental bookmarklet.  If you haven't done something like this before, it will not be clear what you need to do. In Internet Explorer, you need to select one of the posting windows from the links on the about page and add them to you ""link"" bookmarks.  It's much simpler if you use Firefox.  In that case, you simply drag the link for the bookmarklet to the place on your browser underneath the field that displays the URL.  That will create a little icon that says ""post"" on your browser toolbar.  Anyime you are on a page you want to tag, you click on that icon, and tag away.  That is all there is to del.icio.us really.  It's hard to get going, but once you do, you will be surprised by the results, particularly if you share the tags with others.  If you want a simpler way to understand the power of tagging, I suggest John Udell's screencast.  It's a really good description of how this stuff works.  I am going to try sharing my tags with everyone who reads my blog.  The post underneath this one is an automatic daily post to my blog of everything I've tagged the day before and the tags I used.  I hope you will all find that useful.  Many people ask why Joshua took an investment.  He built del.icio.us almost two years ago and its been up on the Internet for almost a year and a half.  It has a huge number of users and is growing very quickly.   But del.icio.us needed some things that Joshua could no longer provide in his spare time (nights and weekends).  Seth Goldstein thought Joshua could use some capital and introduced us to him.  Joshua needed capital for the two major priorities.  The first is scale.  The service is taking off and it needs to be configured like the popular web service that it has become.  That means boxes, bandwidth, redundancy, etc.  That costs money.  The second is ease of use.  That means tweaks to the user interface that make the service easier to use for non-techies.  That means new features that users have been asking for.  That means spending time writing code, testing it, making the service work better for its users.  Joshua's hope is that by dedicating himself full time to the service it will become better for its faithful users and better for new users.  That feeds right back into the community because more tags means more shared information which is what this is all about.  The question everyone asks is ""what is the business model"".  To be completely and totally honest, we don't yet know.  This was a seed investment and none of the investors put up very much capital.  Joshua retained complete control of the service and is going to focus on making it better.  That is all anyone wants to see happen right now.  In time it will become clear what the business model should be.  And there are a number of them to choose from for sure.  In summary, we believe tagging is important, its here to stay, del.icio.us is a very important participant in the tagging phenomenon, and we are really excited to be part of its development."
Audience Management,fredwilson,2005-10-03 15:18:22,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"What is Audience Management?  It's the ability to track your audience and customers, know who they are, what they like, how they behave, etc. Done right, it can allow a business to improve its relationship with its customers and potential customers. Businesses have been doing audience management forever. It's probably one of the most critical aspects of a well run business.  One of the great things about the Internet is that its turns audience management from an art into a science. If you have one or more Internet channels for your business (websites, email campaigns, etc) you can do audience managment.  You can collect data from your customers with their permission. The simplest thing you can do is collect email addresses. Back in 1996, when Seth Godin walked me through the whole concept of Permission Marketing, i was sold. I invested in his company Yoyodyne and enjoyed an early taste of Internet-based audience management.  Most businesses with an Internet channel collect email addresses and use them to talk to their customers. But an email address just isn't a lot of information about a customer or potential customer. You can ask them to volunteer more information about themselves. One of the best ways to do that is to force them to register. Online stores can do that as part of the checkout process. Non-commerce sites can do that by requiring registration. A lot of online publishers are adding forced registration as a way to improve their audience management.  But what do you do with all of this data? That's where audience management systems come in. These systems allow you to database all of this information and use it to do interesting things with it. It's a new emerging market with only a couple of companies selling audience management systems today. I am an investor in one of them, Tacoda Systems, which is the leader and creator of this market space.  Over time, I expect this market will turn into a very large and profitable business. Why? Because marketing is moving from a push/stupid model (buying super bowl ads) to a pull/intelligent model (Amazon knowing i like Dave Matthews and alerting me to his new album). This move is big and its happening in real time and will change the landscape of business as we know it. And audience management is central to this change.  I am interested in Audience Management because of my investment in Tacoda, but also because its a big deal. And i am going to write more about it. There's a lot of exciting things happening in this market. So stay tuned."
Union Square Ventures,fredwilson,2005-09-27 15:21:11,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Often in our business you work on things for months and even years without being able to talk about them outside your immediate group of colleagues and family members. Secrecy is required for competitive or regulatory reasons.  So it has been with me for the past 18 months.  In October 2003, around the same time that I started this blog, my partner Brad Burnham and I started a new venture capital firm called Union Square Ventures.  From that date until now, those words have never appeared on this blog. Because the first thing you need to do when you start a new firm is raise a fund. And there are rules that prohibit using the media to “condition the market” for a fundraising. Those are the rules that got Mark Benioff and the Google boys in some hot water last year.  Our lawyers were crystal clear with us.  There was to be no talking to the media during our fundraising. And so our quiet period lasted almost a year and a half. Until this morning.  Yesterday, we concluded our final close on Union Square Ventures 2004, LP, a venture capital fund dedicated to making early stage investments in technology enabled service businesses that are disrupting markets, particularly the marketing, media, financial services, and telcomm markets.  This is not a particularly well kept secret even with our quiet period. While we have not talked to the media, we’ve talked to a lot of people about our new firm and our new fund and the word has gotten out. That’s fine with the regulators, our lawyers, and us.  And we’ve made two investments already, in Tacoda Systems and Instant Information. Both companies were founded by entrepreneurs we’ve been involved with before and have great confidence in. That is a theme that we’ll attempt to repeat as much as we can because there is nothing better than backing people who you know well and believe in.  But we’ll surely back a lot of people that we haven’t backed before too. And that’s one place that this blog will help. Since I’ve started it, I have met many entrepreneurs I didn’t know. That’s a great thing as far as I am concerned.  And this blog will serve as one way to get the word out about things we like, things we don’t like, and areas we are interested in. That should help entrepreneurs determine whether or not Union Square Ventures is the right firm for them.  But most of all, this blog is about me, not Union Square Ventures. The opinions I express on it are mine, not my partners, colleagues, and investors. You can get a sense of me from this blog, but there is a lot more to Union Square Ventures than me and this blog is only one piece of data about our firm.  If you have a business that you think would be interesting to us, send us an email, and if there is an overlap, we’ll get together and talk about it.  Our contact information is on our website at www.unionsquareventures.com.  I am thrilled with what we’ve built at Union Square Ventures.  My partner Brad is a perfect compliment to me.  We plan to stay small, do our own work, help entrepreneurs build great companies, make our investors a lot of money, and have a great time doing it.  And hopefully, you will all be able to watch us do it via this blog."
10 Steps to a Hugely Successful Web 2.0 Company,ceonyc,2005-10-11 08:05:20,0,0,[],"Do you want to make money in your own home?  Forget real estate scams, tupperware, or becoming a spammer.  Create your own Web 2.0 company NOW!!  Its easy.  Just follow these 10 simple steps and you, too, can be seen in fine dining establishments like Jamba Juice and speaking on panels for conferences like Distribucate 2.0, Fred, Bloggerstock and Elfdex.  1. Solve the smallest possible problem (that is still big enough to matter) for the user and know exactly what problem you're trying to solve. Google's first and primary job was very simple:  Help people find stuff.  They didn't start layering on everything else until much later.  Brad calls this the ""narrow point of the wedge.""  Its the easiest, simplest version of what you're trying to do... the smallest bite your users will ever have to chew--small enough to get hooked on very easily.  2. Get a responsive and chatty audience using the product.  The del.icio.us community eats new features like piranhas.  They pour over the service, discuss it, promote it, and complain when they don't like stuff.  You couldn't have hired a better, more thorough, or more passionate group of alpha testers.  Don't rush to get the service so easy that my dad can use it, because he's not going to really be helpful to you in the early days when you need really hardcore Beta testing.  3.  Launch.  Now.  Tomorrow.  Every day.   Don't wait until its perfect to put it out in the open.  No more closed invite-only betas.  Your idea of perfect may not jive with your users' ideas of perfect.  Put whatever you can out there and get people using it as soon as possible.  Feed them daily with new features to keep them interested and coming back.  No one likes waiting six years for new releases.

4.  Distribute.  Distribute.  Distribute.    Don't force your users to play on your site in a walled garden.  Let them take the service and use it wherever they want.  (See Flickr badges, Google Ads, Amazon affiliates, Indeed jobrolls, del.icio.us linkrolls, moblogging, RSS, e-mail alerts, etc., etc....)  Instead of building it so they will come, go out and get them by placing little bits of your service everywhere on the web.  Be where they are.

5.  Don't hold users against their will.  If they want to leave, let them pick up with all of the content they created while they were on your site and leave... for free.  Charging $0.29 to get back each of the hi rez photos you uploaded to the site (See my upcoming Snapfish post) is thievery.  You have to let the barn door open and focus on keeping your customers fed, so they want to come back, instead of coming back because they're stuck.

6.  Be mindnumbingly simple.  Extra clicks are deadly.  People just won't do it.  Indeed:  One search, all jobs.  Two boxes:  What job and where.  You can't get any easier than that and all it takes is for someone to put one search in for people to go, ""Wait...what's this... links to Monster AND Careerbuilder??""   7.  Get people hooked on free.  Craigslist wouldn't have become Craigslist if it wasn't free for so much for so long.  Even now, they're very profitable and they're only charging for just a few small pieces of their service in just a handful of their 120 markets.  The world is changing.  Service is cheaper to provide now than ever and users are expecting to get more for free than ever before.  Its hard for a lot of big companies to accept that.  I just had lunch recently with a couple of friends from a music publisher.  They were signing some bands to ""incubator"" deals for just a couple of songs to test the market with them.  I said, ""And you're giving those songs away for free, right?""  They nearly choked on their food.  :)    Well, why the heck wouldn't they?  Give a few songs away for free, generate buzz, get lots more people to buy future albums.  Seth Godin did that with his books, releasing e-books that generated buzz around hardcover sales.  Free sells.  Do you think the Facebook would be the Facebook if you had to pay for your smooches  like you do on Match?  8. Don't waste any money on marketing.   Word of mouth has never ever been easier or less expensive in the history of human communication.  Things go viral in a hurry... when they're good.  Ever see a Skype superbowl commercial?  No, but they've had 146 million people download it.  If you don't have the service and the quality to back it up, no amount of fancy marketing is going to help... and people are so quick to share cool stuff, because they want to be the person ""in the know"".  When they're satisfied, they'll blog about it and e-mail everyone they know.  And they'll tag it furiously on del.icio.us, too.  9.  Don't overfund.  Do you know how many times a day I see companies get funded on Private Equity Week and I'm like, ""What the heck are they going to do with all that money??""  Underfunding a company can be a problem, too, but thinking that more money makes you better is a fallacy.  It probably makes you a bit sloppy and fuzzies your focus.  When you raise $2 million, you're much more likely to have a clear sense of exactly where that money is going to go than if you raised $20 million.  10.  No one sucks.  I hate it when someone says that a whole service sucks.  Now, I say it myself, I'll admit, but what that does is it teaches you to discount and generalize, and probably miss a lot of small opportunities that add up.  Now, I think Ofoto sucks versus Flickr, but people still use it.  Why?  There's got to be something there.  AOL sucks... or does it?  They still have 20 million users, so it can't entirely suck.  You should look at every competitor and take the best of what they do right and do it yourself, even if that's only one thing and the rest of their service sucks.  "
Founders,fredwilson,2005-10-11 08:11:07,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I just finished John Battelle's The Search.  It's a great book.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in business, technology, marketing, and the internet.  One of the things I that I enjoyed most in the book was John's comparison of Google and Yahoo!.  I won't quote from the book here.  If you want to read that part, get the book.  The most interesting thing about the comparison was the roles of Jerry and David at Yahoo! and Sergey and Larry at Google.  Both were Stanford grad students.  Both started the companies in their dorms.  Both are still with their respective companies.  But at Yahoo!, Jerry and David are part of the management team, but don't run the company.  At Google, Sergey and Larry are in charge, along with the third member of the troika, Eric Schmidt.  It's a very different model.  And it got me thinking about the role of founders in general.  Founders contribute something to companies that is very special.  It's the core DNA of most companies.  Many founders step aside at some point from the CEO role.  Many times that happens at the urging of the VCs.  Many times they do it on their own, recognizing that they don't enjoy actually running a company.  But the tricky part is keeping the founders engaged and involved once they'd stepped down from the CEO role.  So in that regard, I am actually more interested in Jerry and David than Sergey and Larry.  From reading John's book, Sergey seems like Bill Gates.  I suspect he'll be at the helm for a long time at Google.  But how do you get someone of the caliber of Jerry Yang or David Filo to stick around and keep working on moving the company forward.  I don't think its a coincidence that Yahoo! alone out of the web 1.0 portals has made the transition to web 2.0.  In fact, Terry Semel's talk at web 2.0 was essentially a description of how a large portal can use web 2.0 techniques to remake themsleves.  How did Terry come up with that plan?  Not alone, I am sure.  My bet is that the founders had a lot to do with this. They are still of the web. They get what's going on and they can translate it into a strategy that Terry, Dan, and the team can execute.  That is enormously valuable. But how did Yahoo! keep them around?  Marc Andreessen moved on from Netscape.  Joe Kraus moved on from Excite.  Fuzzy Mauldin (Lycos) and Louis Mounier (Alta Vista) are long gone too.  Many web 1.0 founders left their companies and moved on to start new companies.  That's fine and frankly expected.  But not great for the companies they founded.  I'd like to find a formula (like the one Yahoo! has found) and bottle it.  Because I believe companies that can keep their founders engaged and motivated are so much better off than those that cannot."
Hello World,BradUSV,2005-10-12 16:41:52,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Anyone who has been to our site before will notice a very different look and feel today. When we launched Union Square Ventures last year, we put up a web site that described who we were, how we saw the market and where we planned to invest. Today, we are still the same people, but the market we invest in is changing rapidly and we learn so much every day about the market that the investment thesis on our prior site already seems dated. We thought about updating our thesis, but realized that we would find ourselves in the same place six months from now. We realized that our thesis evolves incrementally as a result of our dialogue with the market, and that the best way to manage that was to accept that we would never get to an answer, so we should just publish the conversation. The best way to do that is with a blog. So here it is."
Metrics,fredwilson,2005-10-15 06:55:13,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We like to make our initial investment sometime between the formation of a business and the first dollar of revenue coming in the door.  Sometimes that time period lasts a while.  In the interim, how do you monitor how an investment is doing?  Even after revenue starts rolling in, its helpful to have alternative metrics to monitor the growth and health of a business.  What we do is develop metrics for each investment, usually jointly with the management team, that we will use to monitor progress.  I know that this smacks of the bubble era when public companies were being valued on the basis of page views. But absent revenues, earnings, and cash flows, you need something to work with.  Page views are one metric that we look at.  Another is unique visitors per day, week, month. With the advent of RSS, its important to monitor how much consumption happens via that channel.  Most of our companies do something that is more than just content on a website.  So we like to identify a company specific metric and monitor that.  In the case of Indeed, we like to watch the number of searches per month.  In the case of Delicious, we like to watch the number of postings per month.  In the case of Tacoda, we like to watch the amount of behavioral data being captured in the TAN network.  We do not attempt to turn these numbers into a valuation.  That kind of thinking is foreign to us.  I read recently that the Weblogs/AOL deal values blogs at $600 to $900 per inbound link.  That would make my personal blog worth $2.3 million.  I am not a seller at that price or any price, but that still seems like a crazy way to value something.  What we do is use these numbers to monitor our investment thesis and make sure the opportunity is playing out the way we think it will.  And we use them to find places where we need to work harder on the service to make it better.  And we use them to show new hires, new partners, and new investors that the business is on a solid trajectory.  I was emailing with my friend Tom Evslin yesterday about some data he was looking for. I called him a ""data junkie"".  It was a compliment.  He wrote back that:      We gotta know whether we’re making this stuff up or it’s real  Exactly.  Web based businesses have incredible amounts of data that they spit out. It is critical that the management team and investors monitor that data closely to keep a handle on the business and its progress.  It's a skill we work on every day."
"Management Case, Base Case and Worst Case",fredwilson,2005-10-20 05:21:30,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Early stage venture capital investing is not really a numbers oriented business.  Its much more important to have a feel for technology, markets, and people than numbers.  But there are times when numbers are important.  Two of the most important times you want to focus on numbers are:   - when you want to figure out what kind of returns you can expect for a particular investment
 - when you want to figure out how long the cash you are investing will last  I've seen this done a bunch of ways over the years, but the methodology I like best is to do a three case analysis; management case, base case, and worst case.  I was taught this approach by the team at JP Morgan Partners with whom I worked very closely building and managing the Flatiron Partners portfolio.  When they do a buyout or growth equity financing, they get into the numbers in a big way and their three case analysis is incredibly detailed.  We always struggled a bit to map the buyout investment process to early stage venture capital and sometimes it was like trying to put a round peg in a square hole.  But I found that the three case analysis works really well in the venture capital investment process and we use it at Union Square Ventures all the time.  What you do is this:  Get the management of the company you are considering an investment in (it could be an existing portfolio company if you are doing a follow-on round) to send you their financial model. Dig into it, understand how it is built, figure out where the drivers of revenues and costs are, and then figure out how to change them.  The original model is the management case.  You don't need to make any changes to it for the first case.  Then step back from the model and think really hard about the challenges they are going to face in executing the business.  Can they hire as fast as they want?  Can they launch new products and services as fast as they want?  Can they ramp sales as fast as they want?  Then go back to the model and figure out what you really think the revenues will be.  This is your Base Case.  I generally recommend keeping the ""fixed costs"" the same as the management case.  Don't adjust headcount down.  Only adjust down costs that are really completely variable with revenues.  Then step back again and think about what your nightmare scenario is.  Maybe its that there will be no revenues at all for the time period you are modeling.  Maybe it is that revenues will be flat.  Or that they will grow very slowly.  Whatever is the worst you can imagine, take the model there.  THen adjust down headcount and costs across the board. But assume that it will take some time before management realizes that things aren't working well and build that time delay into your reduced costs.  This is your worst case.  For the venture capital investment process, you don't need to do too much more.  At this point, I suggest building a summary page where you lay out the profit and loss statement and cash balances for the time period you are modeling.  Then do some valuation analyses on the P&L numbers to show what kind of value can be created in each of the three cases.  You might even assign a probability to each case and get to a probability weighted valuation.  But probably the most important thing that you want to focus on is the cash balance (see my cash is king post). Take a look at how long the money you are investing will last in each of these three scenarios.  And look at what the business is likely to be worth in each of the three scenarios when the money runs out. That will tell you if the suggested raise is enough money or not.  Most of what I have just written is aimed at people who are in the venture capital business, but I think its important for entrepreneurs to understand this methodology because its going to be used by investors who are considering an investment in your company.  For entrepreneurs, I have some suggestions.   - build a good solid model that has at least a couple years of projections for revenues, cost, headcount, etc.
 - make sure to create a cash flow projection that ties into the profit and loss.  ideally you'd have a full balance sheet projection.
 - make it easy to adjust the model so that it can be used for a scenario analysis
 - do the worst case analysis before the venture capital investors do it so you'll be prepared for the conversation  Charlie and I are working on one of these right now and the original model we got from the company was really well done.  But the drivers were built using a drop down box with various percentage reductions in it.  If you wanted to use a number bigger than what was in the drop down box, you were stymied.  I guess that company couldn't imagine a worst case as bad as we could! We asked them to open up the model for us and they were happy to do it. The point of this little story is that investors are always going to imagine a worst case that is worse than the entreprenuer is.  That's the nature of the Vc/entrepreneur relationship.  But focusing on the numbers before you write the check is always a good thing. And it often puts issues on the table for discussion that are ultimately beneficial for everyone."

Union Square Sessions 1 - Transcript,fredwilson,2005-10-23 10:18:18,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"It took a couple days, but we've uploaded the entire transcript of the first Union Square Sessions, an event focused on the topic of peer production and open data architectures.

Peer Production in Action,fredwilson,2005-10-24 16:37:19,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"This is a really great story about the power and perils of peer production.  This morning Brad told me that there was a reformatted version of the transcript of the Union Square Sessions event on our wiki.  I assumed that Charlie did it last night.  Since Charlie sprained his ankle yesterday playing softball he wasn't in today and I made the change to the blog post below annoucing the availability of the new versions.  In our regular Monday meeting this afternoon, I thanked Charlie for doing the reformatting.  And he told me he had not done anything of the sort.  We all laughed about it and wondered who had done it.  Then I noticed a comment to the post below from ""Anonymous Reformatter"" taking me to task for taking credit for his work.  So this is a public apology for doing that.  Certainly it was not our intention to do that.  And second, this is a public thanks for all the work that others have done to extend and improve the conversation around peer production and open data architectures that we had in the Union Square Sessions event last week.  It's a new and wonderful world we find ourselves in."
"We don't ""get it"" ",BradUSV,2005-10-24 17:05:06,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"One of the first posts that came out of Sessions was Joel Spolsky’s comment on architecture astronauts.  Joel said.  I'm starting to see a new round of pure architecture astronautics: meaningless stringing-together of new economy buzzwords in an attempt to sound erudite.  That's one sure tip-off to the fact that you're being assaulted by an Architecture Astronaut: the incredible amount of bombast; the heroic, utopian grandiloquence; the boastfulness; the complete lack of reality. And people buy it! The business press goes wild!.  Now it's tagging and folksonomies and syndication, and we're all supposed to fall in line with the theory that cool new stuff like Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Del.icio.us are somehow bigger than the sum of their parts. The Long Tail! Attention Economy! Creative Commons! Peer production! Web 2.0!  The term Web 2.0 particularly bugs me. It's not a real concept. It has no meaning. It's a big, vague, nebulous cloud of pure architectural nothingness. When people use the term Web 2.0, I always feel a little bit stupider for the rest of the day….. The very 2.0 in Web 2.0 seems carefully crafted as a way to denigrate the clueless ""Web 1.0"" idiots, poor children, in the same way the first round of teenagers starting dotcoms in 1999 dissed their elders with the decade's mantra, ""They just don't get it!""  We agree with Joel that a lot of the discussion about Web 2.0 takes place at a level of abstraction that makes it hard to extract actionable ideas. We also agree that there are folks out there who talk enthusiastically about the transformative power of Web 2.0 without a lot of critical analysis on where, why and how that transformation will occur.   Joel goes on to suggest that it is not productive to talk or think about the implications of information technology at an architectural level. Here, we disagree. We believe that it is possible to talk about technology at that level and that if that work is combined with critical analysis; we believe the output can be very useful.   Joel’s critique of the use of the term Web 2.0 is valid. We agree that the term is often used as an overly simplified shorthand for a number of complex ideas. We share Joel’s concern that the term is sometimes used to separate those who “get it” from those who don’t. This seems, to us, to be a useless distinction. Worse, it limits the input from people whose views we need if we are going to better understand the changes we are likely to encounter over the next few years.  We posed a number of questions in our Sessions Agenda . We learned a lot during the event but, we still can’t answer most of these questions definitively. If we could, we might claim to “get it” But we can’t, so we should raise our hand and say explicitly we don’t “get it”. When we do we’ll let you know."

Sessions Top Ten Insights - One,BradUSV,2005-10-27 11:52:22,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"As we get a chance to go back through the transcript of Sessions, we are finding a number of themes that are worth highlighting.  We will try to get these thoughts up on the site over the next week or so. Our first observation is that we may need a finer grained definition of “peer production”  Since Yochai Benkler coined the term peer production in his 2003 paper Coase’s Penguin, it has been used to describe Wikipedia, Linux, peer to peer file sharing, Skype, Google’s page rank algorithm, Craigslist and many other services. As we understand this phenomenon better, it is clear that there are some important distinctions between these examples of peer production.     Tim O’Reilly’s thinking on this was formed by Dan Bricklin’s 2001 paper, the Cornucopia of the Commons:  “[Dan] pointed out [that you can either] get volunteers to [produce a good] or you can architect the system in such a way that it's produced as a byproduct of people's individual selfish activity.  And I thought that was a really profound insight, because a lot of peer production examples that we see, like open source software or Wikipedia are ... people coming together [on a] network….to build something [they] consciously contribute to.  Whereas Napster was a great example of a system that was built in such a way that people were just pursuing their own activities, but because of the way the system was designed, you created, as a side-effect, this…  peer good”.  
    Yochai Benkler offered a new term, social production to encompass both forms of production.   “I've actually started to use the term social production to cover the two distinct phenomena. [For] individual action…. that gets coordinated [later] by some platform, [I use] ""commons based production”  (people created web sites and linked to other web sites for their own reasons, Google recognized an opportunity to exploit that effort to improve search with page rank)… “and [I use] peer production [for] the more self-conscious cooperative platforms” (Wikipedia).      Jeff Jarvis added two other examples of commons based production.   “I create my iTunes list, I'm consuming music, but I'm [also] creating a radio station.  When I'm consuming peer to peer, I'm helping create the network”
   But it is not clear that there are only two forms of social production. Some of the users of Craigslist, for example, are there for their own selfish purposes (to sell something) but their content is contributed to a community that is not exactly a commons. Likewise, users of Skype use the service to communicate less expensively, and do so knowing that they are contributing resources to all of the other Skype users, but Skype is also not a commons. Are these examples of yet another form of social production that we need to define?  These are not idle questions. If you plan to build a business that depends on the output of a peer network (or to invest in one) it is critical to understand how and why they are different."
Sessions Top Ten Insights  - Two,BradUSV,2005-10-28 10:25:21,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Social production systems seem to deliver a much higher portion of the economic value created to the consumers than traditional production systems do.      As Tim O’Reilly says,  ""if you look at …  Ebay or Google, even though they're very, very successful companies, they're actually pretty generous in creating value for people outside the company"".  This may be because peer producers could get restless if they felt that too much of the value they created was being appropriated by others. It could also be happening simply because the economics of social production make it possible for people to be generous.   
  
But, Tom Evslin pointed out that generousity can be used as a competitive weapon.

""if we think of Craigslist's strategy, it's a brilliant anti-competitive strategy and I don't mean a value judgment by that.  How do you compete with them? If you're not in the areas that they charge for, then you can't make any money because you can't charge for those areas either.  So you can say, ""Okay, well, I'll go compete in San Francisco by giving the ads away,"" but you don't have the readers in San Francisco.  So what they've done is they've said that I've got the network effects from all the places that I give the ads away that I use to make the ads more valuable in the places that I sell them.  And so I don't think it's just negligence that they haven't got around to charging for the other places.  It's deliberately focusing the value on where they're extracting the money.  It's like the Microsoft strategy of always pricing under Lotus, because you just don't want to leave any room for a competitor.  And so here's the brilliant I'll price it free in most places so you can't go around me and get in anywhere, and I'll expect value from a few sweet places which you can't beat me there because the value I'm giving away for all the free places""

Whether this was conscious on Craig’s part or not, it has made it difficult for an entrepreneur to enter one of Craig’s markets with an offer that is less generous to the end consumers.  "
Sessions Top Ten Insights - Three,fredwilson,2005-11-02 05:38:25,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Umair Haque said something (or actually quoted someone) at our Sessions event that has been rattling around my brain for the past week.    Umair said:

    Herbert Simon said it in 1971, which is that ""What does an abundance of information create?"" A scarcity of attention basically, right?  So I went to Wikipedia and looked up Herbert Simon and found out that he was a cognitive psychologist who made significant contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence, economics, and philosophy.  A more ""blown out"" version of Umair's quote of Simon is:      ""What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it."" (Computers, Communications and the Public Interest, pages 40-41, Martin Greenberger, ed., The Johns Hopkins Press, 1971.)  With that concept rolling around in my mind, I had lunch yesterday with a bunch of smart people at the Shake Shack.  We got talking about RSS feeds.  Joshua Schachter asked Brad Feld how many feeds someone has before they reach the saturation point. We didn't exactly answer that question, but I am sure someone will do that work shortly and give us the answer.  It will be some meaningless number like 52.3 or something.  But I can tell you this.  I am way past the point of saturation and I keep adding feeds.  At this point, I have over 100 feeds subscribed to in various readers.  And I have frankly stopped paying attention to most of them.  But this issue is not limited to feeds. I have been using a lot of new web services lately.  It's part of my job to do that.  New companies submit business plans for us to evaluate. The first thing we usually do is use their service. Most of what is getting built today requires a fair amount of user participation and thus a lot of attention. I have stranded so many web services that its not even possible to count them.  I joked recently that I am giving my family ""continuous partial attention"".  They don't like that and demand more.  And I give them more.  Blogs and web services can't demand more attention very easily. So they get less.  Most of us have day jobs.  Many of us have families.  So we have a limited amount of attention left.  And I suspect we are consuming most of it with what we've got on our plates today.  So where does the attention come for the next wave of blogs and web services?  From the old ones, I guess.  In my case, its not going to come out of my family's attention allocation or my firm's.  So attention is a zero sum game and if we are creating (at an exponential rate?) more uses of attention, then we are facing a looming attention crisis.  That's all I can offer at this point.  I don't know when that crisis will hit and what its effects are going to be.  Maybe something will come along that allocates attention more efficiently (delicious or digg?) and the crisis will be averted for now.  I suppose anything is possible, but I feel in my gut that we are facing a ""poverty of attention"" and something is going to give."

Sessions Top Ten Insights  - Four,BradUSV,2005-11-03 10:48:29,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Here are some more of the insights that we gained from our Sessions discussion...    Michael Parekh makes the point that all peers are not created equal…  “Another thing, the term peer to peer, one of the things that's implicit, unfortunately, is that everyone is participating in an equal way, and the reality is in terms of all these others people talk about, from Napster to Wikipedia, the number of people that are actually doing -- contributing content, it's typically a much lower percentage.  … If you look at the number of people who read blogs versus write blogs, the number of people who put comments in and who actually have their own blog, I mean, typically you're talking about percentages that are a fraction of the whole system. And one of the things that I'm trying to figure out in a lot of these examples is which of the systems that have lower friction points.  Like Del.icio.us, where you would assume that a lot more people, because it's easier to put tags in, are participating and contributing to the system as opposed to just taking things out, and one of the things we need to be mindful about in all the peer to peer conversation is how do you make these systems more efficient? How do you get more people to participate, whether it's trust factors, shyness factors, learning the tools.” .  Tim O’Reilly reminds us that the systems with the least friction are the ones that we participate in unconsciously...  
“Everybody participates in Google, because they figured out how to leverage what people do implicitly”  We agree with Michael and Tim that the sponsor of any peer produced service should always be trying to make it easier to participate… to reduce friction, but we would also note that it is not necessarily a bad thing that a small number of producers can create value for a large number of consumers. Leverage in any system is key to the creation of value. It is a good thing that hundreds of thousands of active taggers at del.icio.us have created a utility That helps millions discover things on the web that they could never find with search.  The key insight here is that there are a number of ways to create leverage in a peer produced web service, and that the leverage will be different depending on the service. Services that create value for large numbers of users with a small number of active participants have a lot of natural leverage, but that is only on way to create leverage. Reducing friction to facilitate participation is another.  Skype, however, appears to create leverage with a model that assumes that a large number of participants will share their idle bandwidth and CPU with the small number of consumers who are active at the moment."
Will Live Kill?,fredwilson,2005-11-04 08:50:56,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I posted on my personal weblog about Windows Live and the threats that it may or may not pose to startups working in the web services market the other day.  It fostered some good discussion in the comments section of that post and also at our annual meeting yesterday.  That discussion, which started on my personal blog, moved to the comments section, and then resulted in a live conversation at our annual meeting is a very good example of what we are trying to do with the Union Square Ventures weblog.     Windows Live and its impact on the web services market is an important topic and we've now spent a bunch of time discussing it and thinking about it.  After all of that, I wrote another post on my personal weblog this morning which I will repost in its entirety here.  I hope this stimulates even more discussion and learning.  ----------  Thanks to everyone who posted comments and linked to my Will Live Kill post.  It's always amazing how much you can learn by simply putting your thoughts out there and listening to what comes back.  In this case, the key point for me was that this is Live 1.0 (Windows 1.0 was lame too).  And that over time, Microsoft is going to invest in and improve this service.  So in trying to figure out if Live will kill, the key question is how long it will take Microsoft to make Live compelling?  Yesterday, they did something to make it compelling to Union Square Ventures.  Microsoft bought FolderShare, the folder sharing service that we use in our office to keep all of us synched up no matter where were are.  So now there's at least one thing that I will use at Live.com.  That's a good thing because it will keep me going there and watching how they build this out.  And that move in itself points out a big part of Microsoft's strategy. If they cannot build compelling services for live.com, they will buy them.  So maybe Live won't kill web 2.0.  Maybe it will line the pockets of some web 2.0 entrepreneurs.  hmm."
Sessions Top Ten Insights - Five,fredwilson,2005-11-05 12:24:53,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"  One of the insights from our Sessions event was from Yochai Benkler who said the following about peer production:      we do have very good research on how adding money undermines social motivations depending on contents  I am not sure how to intepret that last part - ""depending on contents"" - but Yochai's point that ""adding money undermines social motivations"" is something that ought to be watched carefully.  One place we can watch it carefully is Amazon's recently announced Mechanical Turk service, mturk.com.  Mechanical Turk is about peer producing HITs.  According to Amazon, a HIT is a Human Intelligent Task, ie something that humans do better than computers.  Like identifying photos or filling out captchas.  If you need a human to do something, you send a HIT request (via the mturk API) to Amazon.  The HIT is displayed to the masses, who then complete them, and get paid for doing so.  This is an attempt to automate peer production and add a payment system on top of it.  So we'll see if this service ""undermined"" by the money involved.  In the meantime, I've suggested to a couple of our portfolio companies who have mundane operational taks that they'd love to outsource to check mechanical turk out.  Let's see what kind of results they get.  Note: You can find the research Fred references on pages 321-328 of Yochai’s paper Sharing Nicely  http://benkler.org/SharingNicely.html where he references the extensive work done by Bruno S. Frey among others. "
VC Cliche of the Week,fredwilson,2005-11-09 06:44:40,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"This one's not really a cliche, but the ""king of the cliche"", Bliss McCrum, used to say it all the time and I love it and am going to use it anyway.  Bliss, who had a large family, used to say that leadership is figuring out where everyone is going and then getting in front of them and saying ""follow me"".  Whenever I heard that, I'd think of Bliss and all of his kids and him running to the front of the line. It's a great visual for me.  Leadership isn't always about figuring out where to take your company.  Many times, the company knows where to go better than you do.   So you have to listen to the company, and the other stakeholders; the customers, the board, the shareholders, etc and make sure that you always know where they want to go.  Then get in front and lead the way.  It's that last part that is so important.  Large groups of people need to be led. Even if they all want to go to the same place, they need someone to lead them there.  And a big ""follow me"" is the best way to get them moving and moving fast.  I have seen CEOs in the past half heartedly accept a strategic move because its what the senior team wants to do or the board wants to do.  But they never really get in front and show the enthusiasm to go in that direction.  Most of those CEOs have failed and brought their companies down with them.  So what do you do when everyone wants to go to a place you don't want to go?  I think the best thing is to resign and move on to an opportunity that you can get your head around.  The bottom line is that when you are in the top job, you need to be enthusiastic about everything you do.  If you can't be, you won't be effective.  That's the truth about leadership."

Sessions Top Ten Insights - Six Reputations Are Not Portable,BradUSV,2005-11-09 17:20:56,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"There was a lot of talk at Sessions about trust. The word appears 33 times in the transcript. Jeff Jarvis mentioned it 11 times himself. Here,  Jeff makes the point that value is shifting from content to trust.     “And so the content isn't what's valuable.  It's the trust and relationship that's valuable, and that to me, in a post scarcity -- what the internet does is it takes away scarcity in terms of both content and distribution, and it changes the value essentially to trust.  So the friction is still there.  The friction isn't ""I own the content and you don't."" The friction is, ""You're going to keep good content? Okay, then let's talk."" It's a different friction, a different value, but that's essentially what we're going towards…..So relationships and trust becomes a new structure.    This led to a discussion of how trust is created on the web, which in turn led to a discussion about eBay’s rating systems one of the largest and most successful systems created to engender trust on the web. If value is shifting to trust then a generalized reputation system could theoretically become the organizing principle behind a large and diverse set of web services. But, Mary Hodder squelched this thread with an important insight about reputations – they are not portable.    “you can pull data for reputation from Ebay.... but the thing about the difference between what Tim was talking about, maps, and Ebay's reputation information is that the mapping data makes sense when you pull it out of the system, whereas the reputation data, because Ebay is so skewed, it's such a bizarre social environment, everybody is under tremendous pressure to make this sort of, you know, A+++ best sale I've ever had, which, I mean, would only exist if the guy who was selling you the thing drove me the item from Kansas or something, otherwise it's just probably B+.  [So]...  the reputation information is perfect or it's terrible, and when you pull it out of that system ... it doesn't match up.  It doesn't translate with other walled garden reputations”  It turns out that every web service defines trust differently, uses it differently and polices it differently, so it may be difficult if not impossible to create a reputation system that is both general and useful. "
Our Customer Is The Entrepreneur,fredwilson,2005-11-12 16:16:11,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Many of the people we know in the venture capital business think their customers are the LPs (the investors in venture capital funds).  We've always thought that was wrong.  The entrepreneur is the customer and the LP is the shareholder. That's the only way to think about the venture capital business that makes sense to us.  What makes this so hard to grok for many in the venture business is that much of the selling we have to do is when we raise money.  Once the money is raised, the entrepreneurs are the ones who come into our offices in ""sell"" mode.  And that dynamic warps many VC's perspective of the business.  We start with the value chain.  The entrepreneur creates the value, they are the ""raw material"" in the venture capital business.  If there were no entrepreneurs, there would be no venture capital business.  So the VCs who treat the entrepreneur like the customer and invest heavily in customer service will be rewarded with the loyalty of the most important component in the value chain.  Money on the other hand is a commodity, whether its in the hands of the LPs or the VCs. Money flows to the best returns and always will.  So if the VC does a good job of serving his customers well and generates superior returns as a result, the money will always be there as long as the price of his fund is reasonable.  That's why we are convinced that the LPs are the shareholders.  That is exactly the same dynamic that exists in company/shareholder relationships.  This ""entrepreneur is the customer"" mantra gets hard in a couple places in the venture capital process.  The first is the VC deal flow process.  We are getting something like 30 new deals a week coming into our office that are generally in our area of interest and are at the stage we like to invest.  We will make investments in roughly four of them per year.  So we have approximately 1500 potential ""customers"" walk in our door a year and only take four of them.  It's natural that the other 1496 will leave our office unhappy at some level and may never return. That's a big customer relations problem.  We try really hard to be helpful, candid, and quick in our triage process, but at our best we might only make a third to a half of the rejected entrepreneurs comfortable with our process and eager to come back.  The second area where customer relations gets sorely tested, and where the ""entrepreneur is the customer"" mantra is the most difficult is when the entrepreneur is not doing a very good job of minding their own store. We believe that once the entrepreneur accepts an investment from the VC, the VC's customer set expands to include the company, its employees, and its customers.  The entrepreneur is still an important customer, probably the most important customer, but the entire stakeholder group in the entrepreneur's company comes into the equation once the investment closes. When the entrepreneur starts failing this expanded stakeholder group, it becomes the VC's job to help them by getting them to change or getting them out of the way.  Most entrepreneurs don't view that as help and therein lies the problem.   But in a funny twist, this is exactly where the ""entrepreneur is the customer"" is the most helpful mantra.  If you really view the entrepreneur as your customer, when you walk into their office with the hard news that you aren't going to keep funding their company if it continues on its current path, or that you want them to step aside and bring in someone better suited to run the company, or that they need to get a coach and start behaving differently if they want to keep their job, you will deliver that news as a friend, a person who honestly cares about them and their dreams, and with compassion and understanding.  And that is the only way to get through those really hard discussions with a chance of coming out the other side with a relationship.  Entrepreneurs are really difficult customers to serve well.  It takes a significant investment of time, energy, money, and intellect to satisfy them.  But if you do it well, you will develop a reputation for great customer service that will keep the best ones lined up at your door.  Union Square Ventures would not exist if it were not for an exceptional group of LPs who we  think of as our shareholders.  We are working to deliver them exception returns in return and we know that focusing on them instead of the entrepreneur is the last thing they'd want us to do."
Sessions Top Ten Insights - Seven - Less Control Can Create More Value,BradUSV,2005-11-15 09:34:23,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"There was a lot of discussion about the relationship between web service providers and consumers. This relationship is obviously especially important in services where the consumers are also the producers of the service. One thread of this discussion was about control. I hate to lead with Jeff Jarvis again but he is so quotable.

 “If you give people control, they'll use it, and if you don't, you'll lose it.”  Jeff’s point here is that consumers increasingly expect control of their web environment, and that most efforts to control or contain them will lower the value of the service to the consumer.  A couple of other threads are less often discussed, but  perhaps more useful to someone building a consumer web service. The first of these, which I have not got a great quote for, was that it is only by giving up control that you can learn from your users. It is intuitively obvious that if you allow users only the choice between a red widget or a blue widget, the only thing you can learn is whether they prefer red or blue, but by allowing them greater control over the way they use your service you can learn much more.  The second thread had to do with abuse. Mike Frumin made the observation:  “if you think about the fact that [the business of] Mastercard or American Express…. is having your data, and … if you found ways to make your information available to you and selectively to other people, a lot of that opportunity [for abuse] goes away.  I mean, you wouldn't get spam about refinancing your house if there was a way for you to tell everyone who was interested in offering you a mortgage that you wanted a mortgage, but there's not…. So in terms of … abuse, the more you are in control, the more you share, frankly, the less room for abuse there is”.

So the provider of web services must, according to Jarvis, give up a substantial degree of control if they are to build and hold and base of users. The good news is that there are benefits to doing so. Learning more about your user base and spending less time and money managing abuse are two, are there others?"
Cliche of The Week,fredwilson,2005-11-16 06:36:15,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Venture Capital is a lot about pattern recognition; in finding good opportunities, in managing them, and in exiting them.  So when I say, ""I've seen this movie before"", something I've apparently said quite a few times on my personal weblog in the past 2+ years, it means my brain has entered pattern recognition mode.  Some movies have happy endings, some have endings you don't want to watch. I've seen both.  When you've seen the movie before and the ending was a good one, it's a great feeling.  You know you are on to something that's going to work out well.  When you've seen the movie before and the ending was bad, it's a terrible feeling. You do everything you can so that you don't have to see it again.  Of course, not every movie ends the same way every time (except in the movie businesss).  Pattern recognition will only do so much for you. But pattern recognition is as good a tool as I have in my bag to try and predict the future.  So if you are in a meeting with me (or anyone else who uses this cliche) and you hear, ""I've seen this movie before"", make sure you ask how the ending was."
Sessions Top Ten Insights - Eight - Putting A String On Data,fredwilson,2005-11-19 05:59:39,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Our sessions event happened almost a month ago and it is starting to fade into my memory.  But there is at least one phrase that came out of Sessions that we are still using with regularlity at Union Square Ventures.  And it came out of this really interesting exchange between Brad and Tim O'Reilly on the subject of ""open data architectures"":  MR. BURNHAM: I wanted to jump on that one-way aspect, because, for instance, one of the things that if you syndicate a piece of data, you know, do you want to have a string tied to that, at least be able to capture the meta data about how it's being used, and does that make it then two way, because if you -- is it the same to syndicate and just let it go and never have no feedback at all about where it's being used, how it's being used, or is the ultimate architecture going to have something to do with -- 
MR. O'REILLY: I'm making a guess here, but I'm making a guess that if you try, actually quote Blake, catch the joy as it flies, the wing or something or other destroys.  Anyway, basically, you have to let -- I think you have to let whatever you do go.  If you try to kind of say, ""Oh, I have the instrument so I captured it,"" you're not going to get it.  
MR. BURNHAM: That's a pretty significant departure from just saying, ""Okay, I'm not going to let it go at all.  You can't crawl me.  I'm not going to syndicate my data.  It's in a box,"" to ""I'm going to syndicate it, but I'd like to be able to at least capture the value that is associated with how people use it,"" to saying ""I'm just going to let it go and I have no idea what's going to happen."" 
MR. O'REILLY: I'm going to make a leap here, and I don't know if it's actually true, if I look at the web and what happened, it wasn't until the web got to a certain scale that it was possible to discover how to recapture the aggregation.  So I think that something happens when you syndicate outwards.  When you let things go, you create network effects.  If you try to optimize prematurely so that you capture the value and you build the aggregate system too early, you limit the network growth.  And that's why often the actual value is captured by a second party, right, because you cannot build it into the system at the outset.  You have to figure out how to, you know, how it's actually implicit somewhere in the system.  Somebody discovers later where that implicit way --   This back and forth between Brad and Tim has been rattling around in my brain ever since because Tim is postulating that open data means ""let it go with no strings on it"" and let others reaggregate it in the future and make the money on it.  That's clearly what happened with web 1.0 where everyone put their content up for the world to see and the search players, led by Google, crawled it and are monetizing it for their benefit.  When we move to syndicated data- via RSS and other technologies - do we have to accept the same deal? Or can we put something into our data (an ad call in a video for example) that allows it to be monetized wherever it goes.  I wrote a post several weeks ago on my personal weblog called The Future of Media where I suggested the following formula for media businesses in the age of syndication:  1 - Microchunk it - Reduce the content to its simplest form.
2 - Free it - Put it out there without walls around it or strings on it.
3 - Syndicate it - Let anyone take it and run with it.
4 - Monetize it - Put the monetization and tracking systems into the microchunk.  It's that last part, monetize it, that is in conflict with Tim's comments at Sessions:

So I think that something happens when you syndicate outwards. When you let things go, you create network effects. If you try to optimize prematurely so that you capture the value and you build the aggregate system too early, you limit the network growth. And that's why often the actual value is captured by a second party, right, because you cannot build it into the system at the outset.   And so we've been talking about strings on data/content in the office a lot lately. And we don't have the answer yet.   Regardless of whether Tim's ""guess"" is right or wrong, it's important to understand the argument and build your business models so they aren't based entirely on putting strings on content because its hard to catch the joy as it flies."
Evolution vs. Intelligent Design,fredwilson,2005-11-22 14:03:36,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"For years, we have been fascinated by the fact that many of the very best startup companies come out of ""side projects"". They are accidents really.  eBay, Google, and Yahoo! are all examples of this mode of starting companies.  Delicious was born this way.  One of my favorite web services, Sitemeter, started this way.  So did Vimeo.  I could go on and on, but like an Oscar speech, I need to stop. Sorry to all the ""side project"" startups I left off this list.  Brad and I have been seeing a lot of ""one man bands"" as well lately.  Companies that have been single handedly started by one person with some outsourced development.  These people see something they'd like to have and they build it.  And all of a sudden, they are in our office with a pitch deck and the need for money to turn the thing they've built into a company.  So I was at breakfast a couple weeks ago with Nick Denton and we got to talking about this phenomenon.  So Nick says, ""it's the evolution vs intelligent design debate"".    Nick is right, there are two ways to build a company (and probably many more).  You can design it from scratch, figuring out exactly what you want to build, getting it all down on paper, raising some money, and then building it.  And there are plenty of success stories for that way of building a company.  Or you can just find yourself doing a startup because something you started as a hobby, or to serve your own needs, just took on a life of its own and you have no choice but to evolve it into a business.  We don't have a preference for one way or the other, but I will say that there is something particularly special about the companies that are created via the evolution approach.  They seem more ""authentic"", to borrow a word from David Beisel.  There is so much more that can be done with this line of thinking, but I am going to stop here. This may become a series of posts where we talk about various differences between building evolved companies versus designed companies.  Or maybe others in the VC/entrepreneur world will pick up on this ""meme"" and run with it, which would be awesome.  I want to thank Nick for putting this idea into my brain. We've enjoyed thinking about it.  I hope you do too."
Cliche of The Week,fredwilson,2005-11-23 17:32:34,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"This is not a cliche but a great line that I heard several weeks ago that I have been using since (so it may become a cliche):  If you must forecast, do it often.  Forecasting is always a difficult proposition and loaded with risks for the person doing the forecasting.  We ask each of our companies to go through a budget process at year end (right now) and set the goals for the following year.  That is essentially a forecasting exercise (on the top line at least).  And many of our companies have incentive comp plans (equity or cash) that depend on hitting the budget or somewhere very close to plan.  So the risk of missing the forecast is real and tangible to everyone in the senior management of the company.  When a company has no revenues, this isn't a big deal.  And when a company has $50mm in revenues and is growing at 20% per year, its not that big of a deal.  But when a company has a couple million in revenues and is trying to double or triple that (in the ""launch stage"" before ""escape velocity""), there is a lot of risk in the budgeting process.  And you don't want a team to miss the budget in the first half of the year and have no incentive to try for the rest of the year (like the NY Jets this year).  And then there is the issue of expense structure.  That needs to ramp in advance of revenue growth but how much should it ramp?  These are the kinds of decisions that are hard to make on an annual basis in a company in hypergrowth mode.  So a couple years ago Matt Blumberg and Jack Sinclair, CEO and CFO (now COO) of Return Path came to the Board with an interesting proposal.  They suggested that they develop an annual budget and four quarterly budgets.  And they suggested that at the end of each quarter, they develop a new quarterly budget for the next quarter and beyond, which is essentially a reforecast based on what happened in the current quarter.  The net of this was that we went to a rolling budget processs where there was a big budgeting effort at year end and a shorter one at the end of each quarter.  If you must forecast, do it often.  That approach worked great and got Return Path through several years of hyper growth, multiple acquisitions, and a changing business model and mix.  They have now moved to semi-annual rebudgeting and may get to annual this year. That's the goal of this approach, to grow out of it.  Since then, we have tried this approach with several other portfolio companies and are encouraged by everyone's receptiveness to it.  Forecasting is tricky business, if you must do it, do it often.  UPDATE: Matt Blumberg has posted his thoughts on this topic and his advice to entrepreneurs who want to give this approach a try is really solid.  If you are interested in how to do this well, go read Matt's post."
Cliche of The Week,fredwilson,2005-11-30 05:38:25,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"When an investment doesn't work out, the first attempt to salvage the deal is typically to look for a buyer.  When that doesn't pan out, the next move is often to look for a company to merge with. Usually its another venture backed company.  And many times both companies are struggling.  I have learned to resist the urge to merge two poorly performing companies because as Bliss used to say, ""two lemons won't make lemonade"".  It's easy to convince yourself to merge two poorly performing investments. You might have a good team in one company. You might have some great technology in another. The combined investor group might be able to support the merged company through a new business plan.  It's seductive reasoning.  But its flawed.  The first thing I've learned is that merger of equals, whether they are really small companies or really big companies are incredibly hard to pull off.  You really need a buyer and a seller to make a  work. Someone needs to be in charge and in mergers of equals, its not often clear who that is.  The second thing I've learned is that two products/services that are struggling are at least twice as hard to get working as one product/service that is struggling. Combining forces actually makes it harder to get the company moving in the right direction because you have more problem children to deal with.  When you have an investment that isn't working, its critical to do something about it and not just put more money into it and hope for the best. I think getting the company sold is a great solution. If that doesn't work, it might be best to simply shut the company down because the idea of merging with another struggling startup is generally a really bad idea.  Because two lemons won't make lemonade."
Cliche of The Week,fredwilson,2005-12-07 06:58:33,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Less and less is secret in the world we live in today.  Certainly in the technology business it is hard to keep something under wraps for long.  There is just too much liquidity of information flow that goes on.  But most companies still believe that their core assets, their business strategy, their technology architecture, their key people, their customer list, etc is valuable and should not be made public.  And so it isn't.  But every once in a while, an opportunity comes along that requires that the company provide someone (an investor, a potential hire, a potential merger partner, a potential acquirer, etc) a look inside the company.  The cliche I like to use to describe that process is opening the kimono.  I honestly don't know where I got this phrase and when I started using it, but I've used it for a long time now.  Clearly there's a sexual/sexist origin to this phrase and one would think it originated in Japan.  The Microsoft Lexicon says the following about it:

Open The Kimono: A marvelous phrase of non-Microsoft origin, probably stemming from the rash of Japanese acquisitions of American enterprises in the ‘80s, that has been adopted into the Microspeak marketing lexicon. Basically a somewhat sexist synonym for ""open the books,"" it means to reveal the inner workings of a project or company to a prospective new partner.  It's so funny to read that coming from one of the all-time most famous kimono openers.  I was in Chicago last week and stopped by to see our friends at Feedburner and happened to use this phrase in that meeting.  Dick Costolo told me that I owed him $1 because that phrase had been so overused by a former colleague that payment of $1 was now required by anyone who uttered it.   I didn't pay him the $1 but we all agreed that it is a really good and descriptive cliche.  Entrepreneurs open the kimono when they talk to VCs and must be careful about that.  VCs are, by nature, opportunistic investors who like the see the entire market when they invest.  So they will want to meet with everyone working in a particular market space before they make an investment.  We do that at Union Square Ventures to the degree that we can, and we make our approach very clear to everyone who walks in the door.  We also have a reputation to protect so we are careful what we do with that information.  We use it to inform our investment decisions, but we don't share it outside of our firm.  It doesn't take too many situations of information leak to sully a firm's reputation.  There are times in business when you must open the kimono. But just be sure you know what you are getting into when you do that. There are companies out there, such as Microsoft and Google, who love to get you to open your kimono but also have reputations for one night stands."
A Delicious Eight Months,BradUSV,2005-12-09 13:03:50,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"On April 14th, we closed an investment in Delicious.  We wrote about  our initial investment here.   Eight months later, Delicious has been sold to Yahoo!.  The news is on the Delicious blog.  We are thrilled to see Joshua Schachter, one of the most interesting entrepreneurs we have worked with in a long time, realize a dream.  He built Delicious at night and on weekends, left his safe and attractive job to bet everything on it, and came up a winner.  Congratulations Joshua.  We have enjoyed working with Joshua. We are pleased to have been part of the team that transformed Delicious from an interesting side project into an important company with strong leadership, a clear vision and a large and growing group of devoted, active users.  We have long felt that, in a world awash in information, navigation and discovery would be increasingly important. Algorithmic search has proven to be invaluable, but it has limits. We invested in Delicious because we believed that its invention of a new form of people powered discovery would address a class of web navigation problems that could not be solved with algorhythmic search.   Many of the users who contribute tags to Delicious do so because they believe they are making the internet more useful for everyone. We believe that Yahoo! understands this. The way they have handled the Flickr acquisition gives us comfort that Yahoo! will pursue Joshua’s vision of an open data architecture which will be the foundation for a whole new ecosystem of innovative web services.  This has been a great ride. Together, we built something of value—for Yahoo! certainly—but hopefully for the web at large. At Union Square Ventures, we will continue to work with talented entrepreneurs to mine the vein of community, peer production, media disaggregation and reaggregation, and discovery to build valuable businesses.  We hope to find many more interesting opportunities like this one in the years to come. "

It's why I am a fan of open the kimono, which according to an asian woman entrepreneur who was in my office last week is offensive.  I apologize for offending anyone who took offense and will be more careful with my use of that one in the future. That said, I still like it.  Visual cliches are great because they pack some extra punch.  One cliche that I use a bit is The Strawman Proposal. I don't even know what the origin of the ""strawman"" term is but to me it means something that you can take apart without consequence.  The image for me is a strawman that you can kick around, pull apart, etc without harming anyone.  I know its kind of brutal, but that's the visual that comes to mind.  A Strawman Proposal is very useful in all sorts of business exercises - budgeting, dealmaking, strategic planning, etc. It is hard to have a really meaty conversation about something without having a reference point.  So A Strawman Proposal serves as that reference point.  It is not meant to be a ""draft"" of the final proposal.  It's meant to be something that ""can be kicked around, pulled apart, etc"".  So its more important that A Strawman Proposal address all the key issues in some way than anything else.  The cool thing (and the reason the word gets used so much) is that you can tell everyone upfront that the proposal is just A Strawman.  That tells everyone not to waste a lot of time and energy on the specifics of the proposal. So poeple don't start negotiating when The Strawman arrives (in theory).  They should just start thinking.  It's a great business trick and a great cliche. The next time you are doing some important business in a large group, start with A Strawman Proposal.  And let me know how it goes."
Cliche of The Week,fredwilson,2005-12-21 06:50:44,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I am not a hunter but I suspect this one comes from the hunting world.  When I think of a Stalking Horse, I think of a hunter on a horse, concealed in some way by the horse, stalking they prey. Again, a pretty brutal image, but that's what comes to mind for me.  In the venture business, A Stalking Horse, is something that is put forward as the real deal but in fact is just a smokescreen for something else.  I have heard the term used in recruiting situations where someone is put up as A Stalking Horse candidate for a job, when in fact nobody has any intent of offering them the job.  And often its an internal candidate that is used as A Stalking Horse. That is a terrible practice and I won't have anything to do with stuff like that. People need to know where they stand, particularly key employees.  Where I tend to see Stalking Horses most, however, is in deal making. A very common trick that is used in venture deal making is to find an investor who you know will offer a very attractive financing deal to the company, get them to offer terms, and then use them as A Stalking Horse to find an investor who is more desired.  It frankly stinks to be used as A Stalking Horse and its happened to me plenty.  But it comes with the territory.  The deal business can be pretty nasty at times.  The most common time that this trick is used is when the existing investors really want to put more money into a company but cannot figure out the right price and terms with the entrepreneur.  So they ""go to market"",  get A Stalking Horse, the terms are set, and the insiders do the deal by themselves.  It happens all the time.  Sometimes the Stalking Horse is given an opportunity to participate, but not always for the amount they really want to invest.  If you are an investor, you need to be able to smell when you are being used as A Stalking Horse.  Most of the time no good will come of it for you so you need to avoid it.  The best way I know is to look for the little things that tell you that a company is really considering you.  Like reference checks on you.  Anyone who is seriously considering getting into business with you will ask around.  If they aren't doing that, or stuff like that, you might be getting set up to be the Stalking Horse.  Another approach is the ""exploding term sheet"" and the ""no shop"" which prevents the company from shopping the deal around.  Those work fine to prevent being used as A Stalking Horse, but for reasons explained in detail in the term sheet series on Brad Feld's blog, they aren't very attractive to entrepreneurs.  The bottom line is nothing is easy. If it feels too easy, maybe it's a fake out.  Don't let yourself become A Stalking Horse."
Cliche of the Week,fredwilson,2006-01-04 09:48:43,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I may change the title of this running series to VC Phrase of the Week since not all of them are cliches in the classic sense.  And this week's is certainly not a cliche, but its something I heard a number of years ago and have found myself saying a lot over the years since then.  The origin of this saying isn't clear, but was attributed to Bill Kaiser of Greylock when I heard it first.  It's about a VC's ""radar"" and it goes like this:

    When I first hear of a company I ignore it, when I hear about them a second time I write the name down, when I hear about them a third time, I get them in for a meeting.  I am sure I've bastardized this quote and I honestly don't know if it originated with Bill, but it does describe one important way we track companies.  VCs all have areas they focus on, in our case its applied technology services.  We all have ways we get a flow of information about new companies, technologies, and people working in our target sectors. And we need a way to determine what is ""noise"" and what is ""signal"".  There are a host of techniques we use.  Our network of trusted relationships is the single best filter we have.  But when we hear about a new company from three different trusted sources, in particular if it happens within a short period of time, its bound to get our attention.  So if you want to get on a VC's radar screen, figure out how to get people, particularly people that are trusted in VC networks, talking about you and your company."
Cliche of The Week,fredwilson,2006-01-11 05:13:29,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Most VCs build portfolios of investments that number between 10 on the low end and 40 on the high end per fund they raise.  This gives us diversification of risk and a host of other benefits.  It is generally true that its hard to know which of the companies will ultimately provide the biggest gains and sometimes its the most unlikely ones that end up being the home runs.  The venture capital process is a long one that requires patience.  Typical hold periods are five to seven years, but they can be much longer.  A lot can change in that kind of time frame.  Over the years, I've had three or four investments that were on deathwatch for a significant period of time only to emerge from that state and start taking off.  My favorite cliche about that kind of turnaround is:      We just went from the outhouse to the penthouse  These investments are often the most gratifying ones. Because they require a lot of work on everyone's part, including the VC, and because they require a tment to making the investment work that is often lacking in the venture business.  That is not to say that the VC should try resuscitation on every investment.  In fact, when something is not working and the reasons you made the investment are no longer valid, you must be able to walk away.  But some deals just take longer and need to evolve before they start working.  Knowing the difference between a failed investment and a slow starter is one of the hardest things to get right in the venture business. It takes experience, intuition, patience, and a deep understanding of the business and the markets the portfolio company participates in.  But if you can identify the slow starter correctly and stick with it, the outcome can often be spectacular.  Going from the outhouse to the penthouse is a great thrill and I recommend that everyone do it at least once."
Web Services in the Mist,BradUSV,2006-01-12 12:06:46,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"More and more, the entrepreneurs we see present their business in the context of an ecosystem. This is a healthy development because it acknowledges the complexity of the environments within which start-ups operate today. Technology generally and web services in particular are no longer exist in their own world, they are increasingly part of the world. Ecology may be a good model for understanding some of these complex interdependencies, but, Fred pointed out earlier this week that maybe it’s not just ecology, maybe its science. Maybe, as web services become an integral part of all of our lives, they must learn to exist in a world that is best understood by analogy to all of the sciences.    Here, for example, is an analogy from biology:  Last fall, Wired ran a story about the sequencing of the Chimpanzee’s genome. One of the most striking revelations was how close it was to ours. Depending on how you count, we humans share 96-99% of the genes in Chimpanzees.    So what does that have to do with web services? Many of the services we see are lightweight hacks (I use that term with reverence) on top of a huge shared hardware software and communications infrastructure. If you were to analyze the entire infrastructure necessary for the delivery of two different web services including the code in the chips, operating systems, browsers and communications systems, you might find that 96-99% of the code necessary to deliver the services is identical.   On the other hand, just as we would like to think that the 1-4% of our genes that we do not share with chimpanzees makes a big difference, the creators of innovative web services argue correctly that the difference between one web service and another is huge.  At the risk of pushing the analogy to the breaking point, it is interesting to think about the difference between web services of the same “species”. One could argue that they share almost all the same DNA, and yet subtle differences can still have a huge impact. Ari Paparo, the founder of an early web based bookmarking service recently compared his service BLINXPro and Delicious.  He points out that two subtle distinctions in the implementation made an enormous difference in the outcome:  1) Blinx mimicked Windows’ hierarchical file system – Del.icio.us used tags to organize bookmarks and 2) Blinx’s default was to keep bookmarks private - Del.icio.us’ default was to share them.   Ari’s insight may also explain why Delicious continues to grow despite being surrounded by many apparently similar services.  Are there any practical applications of this insight? I think so. The entrepreneurs who build the most successful web services will recognize that they share 99% of the same genome with their competitors. They will eagerly exploit any and all of the infrastructure services they can in order to focus their energy to create the most useful innovation within the 1% of code that is not shared. They will also recognize that even the subtle differentiation between them and their direct competitors can still make a big difference, and they will continuously refine their thinking in a dialogue with their users in an effort to get it “just right”.  Next, we’ll try physics."
Rich Media Realities,fredwilson,2006-01-19 21:02:47,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I wrote a post on my personal weblog several months ago called The Future of Media where I invited anyone to take my content (actually my RSS feed) and do anything they want with it.  I suggested that there were four things that content owners needed to do to maximize the value of their content.  These four things are:  1 - Microchunk it - Reduce the content to its simplest form.
2 - Free it - Put it out there without walls around it or strings on it.
3 - Syndicate it - Let anyone take it and run with it.
4 - Monetize it - Put the monetization and tracking systems into the microchunk.  I still believe that this is the best formula for maximizing the value of content online.  But since writing that post, I have been contacted by many different content owners and participants in the media and entertainment business and through the ensuing conversations, I have learned that there are a myriad of reasons that content owners aren't going to free their content as easily as I will free mine.  As I have engaged in these conversations and listened to the business reasons, legal reasons, fears and concerns of content owners, I have come to the conclusion that my nirvana scenario isn't going to happen anytime soon.  So I have spent some time mulling over these conversations, mixing my views with the realities of the marketplace and I have come to the following conclusions:  1 - Content owners should make all of their content available online as soon as possible and they should make it available in both free ad supported media and paid media with no advertising.  The surveys are being done as we speak and its clear that many more people want free ad supported content, but there is certainly a significant market for paid downloads that content owners should support.  2 - Media type doesn't really matter.  The same business models will work for audio, video, text, games, etc. There really isn't any distinction between various forms of media when it comes to online business models.  Bits are bits.  This means that music MP3s should be made available as free ad supported content as well as paid downloads.  That's already happening with podcasting, but it should happen with all music content.  If Pepsi will pay a $20 cpm for a pre-roll ad in the latest Beyonce track, I should be able to get that track for free as long as I listen to the ad before hearing the song.  3 - Free ad supported content should not be DRM'd.  And it should not be possible to fast forward through the ads.  Just like many DVDs come with previews that cannot be fast forwarded, so should ad supported content.  If you don't want the ads, pay for the content.  The ads should be delivered in real time and targeted and should be measurable.  This model will support pass along (ie file sharing) as content owners will make more money as more ad impressions get served.  These free ad suppored files should support a payment mechanism that strips the content of ads if you want to ""own the files"".  4 - Paid content models are going to require some form of DRM (at least in the near term) to enforce the payment mechanism for many content owners, but the current state of DRM technology isn't going to cut it.  The existing DRM technologies do not provide for enough portability (they really need to support every playing device that a consumer would ever want to use and they aren't even close).  And many content owners will live without DRM as companies like eMusic are demonstrating in the music market. Over time, many content owners will move away from DRM as they make more money with free ad supported content and the value of paid content declines.  Ultimately DRM'd content will be limited to very high value niche media.  5 - The market must move to variable pricing.  David Pogue wrote a critque of Google Video in today's New York TImes where one of his complaints was the lack of a consistent price point (as compared to the $0.99 for every song in Apple's iTunes store).  But in this regard, Google has got it exactly right.  Online content needs to be a marketplace just like everything else.  Reruns of I Love Lucy are not worth the same amount of money as the latest Extras episode. The same is true in music.  Beyonce's ""Check On It"" is worth a lot more right now than The Foundations Build Me A Buttercup.  But they are priced exactly the same in iTunes tonite. It doesn't make any sense and it won't last as a business model.   6 - Content must be made available in RSS so that consumers can subscribe to it.  If I do a Google video search and find Charlie Rose and realize that he's really great, I should be able to subscribe to his show right then and there.  RSS needs to support both the paid and ad supported business models described above.  Not all content is going to get consumed in a streaming mode and RSS is vastly superior as a delivery mechanism than manual downloads.  We are witnessing a seismic shift in the distribution of rich media content right now.  In the past five years, we have gone from no legitimate marketplace for rich media content to a world where almost all music is available online and where video is moving online very quickly.  For the most part, it's a paid download market.  But that isn't going to last in my opinion.  Ad supported business models will take off in the not too distant future and will co-exist with paid downloads.  Consumers are going to get the choice, not only of what media they want to consume, when they want to consume it, and where, but also how they are going to pay for it and what they can do with it.  It's an exciting time with a lot of change afoot.  And that should be a recipe for some good venture opportunities.  If you see this world evolving similarly to us and are building a company to take advantage of this opportunity, we'd like to hear from you."
Advertising Out Of Context,fredwilson,2006-01-20 20:34:24,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"For as long as there has been advertising, the advertisers have sought to run the ads in context.  By ""in context"", I mean car ads in the automotive section, banking ads in the finance section, beer ads in the sports section, etc etc.  The reason for this is that context has been the best available form of targeting.  You wouldn't be reading the auto section if you aren't interested in cars, right?  But could it be that advertising out of context works better?  That would be a shocking finding.  Of course, you'd have to have another way of targeting for that to be the case.  Enter behavioral targeting.    Behavioral targeting is the art of advertising to people based on observed behavior instead of by what page or media they are viewing.  The idea has been around for years, but until digital media and the Internet, its mostly been a concept.  Union Square Ventures is an investor in the leading behavioral targeting compapy, Tacoda Systems.  Tacoda really pioneered large scale behavioral advertising with its Audience Management System which was launched in 2002.  Since that time, Tacoda technology has served millions of behaviorally targeted ads on the pages of many of the leading web sites.  In 2005, Tacoda launched a behaviorally targeted advertising network called Tacoda Audience Networks.  This move extended Tacoda's reach into a much larger group of advertisers who did not want to deploy their own behavioral targeting system.  Recently Tacoda sponsored some research conducted by Next Century Media Research.  The research was an ""eye tracking study"" done by PreTesting, one of the leading eye tracking research providers.  In the study, researchers watched the eye movements to determine the number of ""looks"" and the time spent on each ad.  The results of the study were released this week and the press release is here.  The data shows that behavioral ads are 17% more effective in engaging readers than contextual ads.  But more importantly, after the first exposure to both ads, the behavioral ads perform 54% better than contextual.  Bill Harvey, the CEO of Next Century Media, is quoted in the press release saying:  It is probably a combination of more relevancy and less clutter.  It could be that there are just too many ads for the same product category attacking the user's eye in contextual targeting, causing the user to avoid looking at any of them.  As an investor in Tacoda for the past three years, I have been privy to many anecdotal examples of this and I have my own theories for why targeted ads perform better out of context.  I think that if you are interested in cars, you are paying attention to what you are reading in the auto section and the car ads blend in.  When you see them in the sports section, out of context, you pay more attention.  Since behavioral technology targets the auto ad to people who have shown an interest in automotive content, showing them the ad in the sports section seems like a great way to get them to pay more attention to it.  It's not likely that advertisers are going to rush to embrace advertising out of context. Hundreds of years of behavior is going to be hard to change overnight.  But those advertisers who have the courage to give it a try, using Tacoda or another behavioral advertising system, are going to get some really interesting and good results."
Instant Job Board,fredwilson,2006-01-20 20:55:52,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Our portfolio company Indeed.com is doing some great stuff.  For those who are not familiar with Indeed, its a job search engine.  Think Google for jobs.  As Indeed says, ""one search, all jobs"".  Give it a try.  It's so simple and so powerful if you are in the market for a job.  But Indeed's job search can run anywhere.  So if you run a web site and want a job board, you don't have to build one.  You can just host a version of Indeed.  A great example of this is Gawker Jobs which launched this past week.  Gawker is a blog about New York gossip, particularly gossip about the media industry in New York.  Gawker Jobs is just a ""canned search"" on Indeed for media jobs in New York.  But when you go look at Gawker Jobs, you'll see that the featured jobs are perfect for Gawker's audience.  There is another way to host an instant job board and that is called Indeed Jobroll.  We have been running one on our Union Square Ventures weblog since we launched it and today there is a job listing for a CEO for a podcasting startup.  Now that's pretty relevant and we did nothing to make that job show up on our site other than enter a specific search into Indeed and save it as a Jobroll and paste the code into our blog template. We did that once many months ago and its been working flawlessly since.  Pretty cool eh?  We think so."
Indeed Job Data,fredwilson,2006-01-24 11:59:11,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Since I am not in the market for a job, I haven't been spending enough time on Indeed.  But since my post on their instant job board service, I have been playing around with the service this weekend.  And to my surprise and excitement, there is a bunch of real time jobs data that anyone can access for free up on the Indeed site.  Do you want to know where the most jobs are?  Check out this page and the cool job map  Here's the top ten cities right now:

Physics - The Second Law of Thermodynamics,BradUSV,2006-01-25 13:46:50,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"A week ago I stretched my rudimentary knowledge of high school biology to come up with an analogy that, for me, shed some light on web services. Today, I am going to try an analogy from physics which I know even less about.   Most industrial processes produce byproducts. More and more, we see the output of these processes (even the waste) as a potential input for another process. An example of this is co-generation – generating energy from the waste heat of existing industrial processes. Like co-generation in an industrial process, many web services are driven by the data that is created as a byproduct of a user’s interaction with another service.   When you use a search engine to find mortgage deals, you reveal your intention as a byproduct of your search. That intention data becomes the input to a different system – the search engines advertising system. The intention data is a byproduct of the search, not the purpose of the search; it is data exhaust. When Amazon recommends a book, they are using the exhaust from your prior purchases and those of people who have purchased similar books to show you books you may like. People who tag links in Del.icio.us do it so they can find those sites again. As a byproduct, Del.icio.us has created a curated list of interesting things on the web that has become a powerful discovery tool for lots of people who have never tagged anything.  The analogy, however, seems to break down when you compare the potential efficiency of “co-generation” in physics and in web services. In physics, the potential of a co-generation system is limited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics  which says (I think) that the available energy in a closed system can never increase. This means that no matter how efficient your co-generation system, you always lose the use of some of the energy in the system. Otherwise we would have perpetual motion machines. It appears, however, that the exhaust of a web service can be more useful than the service itself. Webmasters linked to other sites to make their sites more useful to their users. That took a certain amount of energy and provided a certain utility to their users. They did not intend to power a search engine. But then Google captured this exhaust and used it to organize the web.  So the extra point question is… does the apparent increasing utility of data violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics? Is data different, or are we fooled by the inherent efficiency of data storage, transmission, and manipulation so that we don’t even notice the incremental energy lost? Perhaps I have not accounted for all of the energy in the system (i.e. the users interaction with the data adds energy). This is more than an academic question. If data is somehow different, even if only the efficiency of its reuse is greater, then it will impact the way web services companies package, deliver and get compensated for the use of their data assets.

Web 2.0 is an Oxymoron,fredwilson,2006-02-01 12:25:55,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I had the pleasure of speaking on a panel on Web 2.0 last week at the New York Software Industry Association (NYSIA) monthly meeting.  It was a fun panel, featuring Dennis Crowley from Dodgeball (now part of Google), Josh Schachter from Del.icio.us (acquired by Yahoo!), Bob Wyman from PubSub, which remains independent, and me.  It was moderated by Howard Greenstein who did a great job of keeping the conversation moving.  At one point, I blurted out that Web 2.0 is an oxymoron.  It had never occurred to me before, but at the moment I realized the irony of the name.  Possibly the greatest thing about these lightweight web services that we all now call Web 2.0 is that they are constantly updated with new functionality. It seems that every day I long onto one or more of them and find new features that have been rolled out without any effort on my part.  Contrast that with the traditional update cycle in software.  Sometime this year Microsoft will roll out Vista and those of us who operate in a Windows environment will take time out of our daily lives to upgrade our operating system.  It will be a painful process.  Some stuff won’t work right after the upgrade.  We’ll need to figure out how to navigate the new user interface.  We’ll fumble around for days until we get the hang of the new software.  It’s even worse for the sys admins who operate large scale application software packages in corporate datacenters.  The upgrade cycles for the technology that powers large enterprises is filled with dread and long nights getting the new stuff working.  It is the very naming convention (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) for new versions of installed software that we take the name Web 2.0 from. People are already starting to blog/think about Web 3.0 and what that will bring.  I think we should drop this version based naming convention on the Web because that’s not how it works best.  The web evolves every day.  There was no 1.0 and there is no 2.0 and there will be no 3.0.  Just a long graceful road we are traveling where the scenery changes every day."
Mathematics - How much is enough,BradUSV,2006-02-02 12:21:37,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"I did not study a lot of science in high school so this reference to mathematics is likely to be my last effort to come up with a model from high school science that sheds light on the evolution of the information technology business.  After eBay’s purchase of Skype, it became clear to many of us that peer to peer file sharing networks were a potentially serious information technology services platform, so I got to thinking about how big this infrastructure really was.

iSupply reported last fall that total PC shipments for 2005 would be 211 million. IDC  recently pegged the number at 209 million. 

 
So let’s assume around 210 million PCs were shipped last year. I tried to get a handle on the size of the average hard drive by playing around with different search terms in Google, but this is not something Google does well. The “expert” on the sales floor at CompUSA told me the average drive they sell these days is 80 Gigabytes.  My friend Sam tells me that, if those numbers are correct, the total storage capacity of the PCs shipped last year is 16.8 Exabytes (10 to the 18th). Sam also pointed me to this post   thinking it might help me wrap my head around how may bytes that really was.  Encouraged, because this seemed like a lot of bytes, I began to wonder if we would ever be able to store more bytes than we could produce.    It turns out that Gordon Bell,  now at the Microsoft’s Bay Area Research Center has been thinking a lot about how many bytes a person can produce in a lifetime.  In this related note he says that as long as you don’t want to store video it is eminently feasible to store a lifetime’s work.  Despite Gordon’s admonition to stay away from video, I thought the best way to think about the most we would ever want to store was to imagine that every person on the planet would store full motion high definition video of every moment of their lives.   So I went back to my friend Sam, who told me the following. It takes about 1.6 Gigabytes to store an hour of HDTV or roughly 40 Gigabytes for a 24 hour day. That means it would take about 15 Terabytes to store an HD video of one persons life for one year. If you multiplied that by the roughly 6 Billion people on the planet, we would need about 87.6 ZettaBytes (10 to the 21st) per year to store all the bytes we could produce in that year.  As foggy as my memory of math is, I am aware that that is a big number and that the gap between 10 to the 18th and 10 to the 21st is substantial. What is remarkable to me, though,  is that once you have stared those numbers in the face, you realize that if the storage capacity of PCs and the number of PCs shipped annually both continue to grow at the same pace, and you make the assumption that there is a limit to the number of bytes a human can produce, we are not that far away from the day when we will be able store all the bytes we can produce right on our PCs.  One could toss that away as another useless piece of information, except that it suggests that there will be a day – sooner than we may have thought – when our most talented engineering resources will turn their attention away from the problem of storing more bytes and to the problem of making better use of the bytes we have already stored. That transition, which may already be underway, will have a huge impact on the development of the information technology business."
Feedburner,fredwilson,2006-02-06 21:03:37,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Union Square Ventures closed an investment in Feedburner today.  We are thrilled to be an investor in this great company which has been leading the way in RSS feed management and monetization services for the past three years.  We have been big fans of the company for a long time but for a number of reasons, we have not been investors until today.  This was not a traditional venture funding round as Feedburner didn't need our money as they had closed a round in early 2005.  But we both decided it made sense for Union Square Ventures to be involved in the Company and so we made it happen.  We'd like to thank the founders of Feedburner and the investors, Portage, Mobius, DFJ, and Sutter Hill for being so cooperative and letting us get involved in such a fantastic company and join a stellar venture syndicate.  We plan to write a longer post about this investment in the next couple days explaining what we like about Feedburner, where we see RSS and feed management going, and what we hope Feedburner will become.  However, the news started leaking out today on the Paid Content weblog so we wanted to make sure you heard it first from us.  Stay tuned for a longer post on this subject in the next couple days."
Why We Invested in FeedBurner,fredwilson,2006-02-07 13:53:24,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Last October, I wrote a post called “The Lady Doth Protest Too Much” in which I told the following story:  Once upon a time, we had a very early stage company in our sights.  We met the Company shortly after it was formed.  We became users of the service, promoted it to a lot of our friends, and got to know the management team really well.  When it came time to consider an investment, we did what all good VCs do.  We got on the phone and called ten people in the industry that we knew really well to get their take on the Company's service.  We heard pretty much unanimously that they ""would never use it"".  We passed on the investment.  But it was a huge headfake.  Because within six months all of the people we called had become customers.  The company in that story is FeedBurner, a company that I have been a customer of, a fan of, and a believer in for over two years.  When we realized that we had been “headfaked” around the time of that post, we called Dick Costolo, one of the four founders of the company and the CEO, and told him we’d made a mistake and wanted to be an investor in the company.  Instead of telling us to screw off, he said “let me and my partners think about it”.  Within a month, we’d worked something out that everyone could get excited about and Union Square Ventures is now an investor in FeedBurner. And we are thrilled about it.  But why are we thrilled about it?  Because we believe in two things that are not yet obvious;  1 – RSS will become mainstream.  I wrote just the other day that “RSS needs to become brain dead simple to use” before it will bust out.  And it’s nowhere close to that now.  But it will become “brain dead simple” because it’s a very simple and powerful technology like http, smtp, etc before it. Apple has already made subscribing to podcasts via RSS in iTunes “brain dead” simple.  And Microsoft is going to make RSS subscriptions “native” in the upcoming Vista operating sytem.  MyYahoo has made subscribing to RSS very close to “brain dead simple” in its web service.  And others are working on this problem as well.  We don’t know if it will be one year, two years, or three years before “soccer moms, myspace kids, construction workers, and grandmothers” are using RSS every day, but it’s going to happen.  2 – The RSS channel will be monetized ""in the medium"" like every other medium. I remember when people thought the web was going to be a tool to drive traffic to offline where it could be monetized.  That didn’t happen.  Now people think of RSS as a medium to drive traffic to the web where it will be monetized.  Some of that is happening, but all mediums develop their own native monetization systems and so will RSS.  This is where FeedBurner is key.  They are leading the way, by a very wide margin, in developing a business around RSS content.  They provide the best and simplest way to market your feed.  They provide the best and easiest to understand analytics around what your feed audience is.  And they have built the first and by far the largest advertising network designed specifically for RSS feeds.  If you have RSS feeds or are planning to offer them, and if you want to make money off of them, at this point you should be using FeedBurner.  I know, I use them and I make more money off of my RSS feeds every month than I make off of Adsense or Yahoo Publisher Network (by a wide margin).  There is a raging debate going on right now on my personal weblog about email vs RSS with many people taking different sides on this debate.  But one thing is clear.  RSS will win at the end of the day for commercial messaging (newsletters, al messages, marketing) because it is better than email for that application.  RSS allows the user to control the subscription and can’t be spammed.   So RSS is going to become a huge business.  But it will take time.  The platform providers (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo!, AOL, etc) will need to work to build it into their offerings in a way that hides the complexity but keeps the user control.  And FeedBurner and its competitors will need to build the business models and monetization systems to make it work as a commercial medium.  We have no doubts that Dick Costolo and his partners and his management team at FeedBurner will lead the way in developing RSS as a commercial medium.  We have been working with them and watching them for over two years and know that they have the vision, the experience, and the motivation to lead this market to its logical conclusion.  So that is why we invested in FeedBurner.  We could not be more pleased to be an investor, finally.  And if you are a publisher who is using RSS or who wants to use RSS as a commercial medium, you should be talking to FeedBurner.  We would be happy to make an introduction."
Research and Development,BradUSV,2006-02-15 18:23:24,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Is it just us, or is there really a sea change in the nature of research and development.  For my entire career in information technology, research was all about cracking very hard technical problems. How to move more bits from here to there, how to store more bits, how to organize bits so they can be retrieved efficiently. It was often not clear that the problem could be solved at all, and speculative research was needed to explore novel approaches to the problem. Once the technical nut was cracked, the project would move to the development phase. Engineering would be assembled and the long march to a marketable product begun.   Back then, the most interesting companies would put their present their technical innovation front and center and describe their market entry strategy as an after thought. Today, it seems that most of the companies we see spend very little time convincing us that they have solved an important and difficult technical problem. They treat the entire technical problem as something that can be done. In short they treat the software engineering as a development problem not a research problem.  But they are doing research, just not technical research in the traditional sense. The most difficult problem is no longer a software engineering problem; it is a social engineering problem. The most innovative companies we see these days seem to spend all of their time trying to figure out why MySpace grows while Friendster plateaus: or why del.icio.us is more popular than Furl.  Some might argue that the technical research being done at places like Google is still an important and defensible advantage. They are probably right, but how much of that research is really focused on fundamental technical questions. Is the evolution of their search algorithms driven by the need for better and faster search, or is it driven by the need to stay ahead of the all of the people trying to game the algorithm. Is it an electrical engineering problem or a social engineering problem?  Research is no easier than it used to be, but it does now seem different. Very few entrepreneurs seem to highlight technical aspects of their software innovation any more. They assume that if they get the social engineering right, they can build it.  When Joshua Schacter recently suggested we retain an anthropologist here at Union Square Ventures, he was only partly kidding. Something is changing in the nature of research and development.

Advisory Capital,fredwilson,2006-02-23 14:00:32,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Stowe Boyd has an interesting post on the idea of advisory capital (as opposed to venture capital).  Stowe observes correctly that many tech startups don't need nearly the amount of startup capital that they used to need to build a business.  We all know the reasons for this so I won't get into them. Stowe mentions a few of them in his post anyway.  And Stowe goes on to point out that many VCs won't or can't get involved in companies unless they can invest millions of dollars ($3 million to $5 million are the minimums for many top tier venture firms).  And so he concludes that many tech entrepreneurs will not be able to tap into the venture capital market for the things that VCs bring in addition to money - advice, counsel, oversight, relationships, etc.  Stowe suggests that industry insiders who have the knowledge, relationships, and experience can fill the gap.  He suggests that entrepreneurs take the notion of an advisory board one step further and put a few strong advisors in the role of VCs.  Put them on the board and give them meaningful stakes in the business (but certainly less than VCs would get) in order to get the advice, counsel, oversight, and relationships that VCs would otherwise provide.  I think Stowe is right that advisors have a growing role in the startup equation for many of the reasons that he articulates.  But I think it isn't possible to completely replace the role of the VC for a couple of reasons.  1 - Unless you have capital at risk or some other form of ""skin in the game"" like sweat equity, you cannot and will not feel the thrill of victory and agony of defeat that binds the VCs and entrepreneurs in startups. Capitalism works for a reason. Greed and fear are powerful forces.  I have worked with many ""independent directors"" over the years.  And they are often incredibly good directors who add value in all sorts of ways.  But they don't feel it in their gut the way the entrepreneur does. VCs, particualarly the best ones, do feel it in their gut. And so they are there for the entrepreneur when they need it most, joined at the hip with the risk/reward belt.  2 - There is a growing market of angel money that is sophisticated and acts a lot like VCs. There are even ""super angels"" like Pierre Omidyar, Mark Cuban, and the like who can invest as much or more than most VCs in a deal they like.  These angels bring most of what a VC firm can bring to the table if they so choose and can write smaller checks.  I'd suggest before entrepreneurs give equity to advisors for no cash, they think about angels instead.  The bottom line for me is that cash at risk is a critical part of the relationship between the entrepreneur and their VCs.  It provides the foundation for all the other roles that the VC plays - advice, oversight, connections, etc.  Without it you won't get close to what you get with a VC."
Web Services and Devices,fredwilson,2006-02-27 14:45:51,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We are witnessing massive innovation in and around web services.  It seems that rarely a day goes by without some new web service being launched.  And the same is true with devices of all sorts.  We have Microsoft’s Origami device being discussed in the blogs this weekend before it’s even announced by Redmond.  We have Amazon’s new music device to consider, and the Samsung Z5 which features software designed by the same guy who did the iPod’s software.  And of course we have new cellphones, PDAs, game players, and digital cameras coming to market in ever increasing frequency.  Yet there is something missing from all this innovation and that is the integration between these new web services and these new devices.  Sure you can upload the photos you shot with your cool Sanyo Xacti video/still camera to Flickr, but its not seamless.  You can watch YouTube videos on your PSP, but it takes some work.  You can put the songs you bought on iTunes in your iPod, but not your new Z5.  The problems are both technical and political. Web services are open for the most part, but some of the most popular ones, like iTunes (which isn’t even a web service) are not.  Devices are almost always closed.  Much of the discussion regarding Amazon’s digital music strategy as well as the debate over the Z5 revolve around whether consumers require an integrated/turnkey solution.  Can consumers figure out how to mix and match web services and devices or must they be served up a complete solution by a single vendor?  I think we all hope that a truly open environment will prevail where devices and services can play together and best of breed will win out on both fronts.  But that is not where we are today and we have a lot of ground to cover in order to see that vision realized.  And the powers that be don’t want it to happen. The businesses whose margins depend on their continued control over a distribution channel – carriers, media companies, and consumer electronic manufacturers - will find it hard to embrace innovation that potentially undermines their margins.  But if the experience of the personal computer and the interenet is a guide, open architectures where many players compete in a decentralized ecosystem do accelerate innovation. When web services integrate with devices in a open architecture, we believe that the consumers' interest in innovation and integration will trump the vendors' interest in preserving control over limited proprietary channels.   If you agree and are working on any aspect of this opportunity, we’d like to hear from you."

We have had the pleasure of working with TACODA for the past four years, since its formation.  And we are thrilled to see its business taking off.  It's a testament to the quality of the management team and the size of the behavioral targeting market."
Looking Ahead,fredwilson,2006-03-23 09:17:08,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I said something on Heather Green’s podcast that I’d like to repeat on this blog.  Heather asked me if our investment strategy was changing.  I told her that when we raised Union Square Ventures’ first fund in late 2003 and early 2004, we were very excited about the coming explosion in web native technology driven services and were determined to find and invest in a number of important ones.  And if you look at the first five investments we’ve made, they all fit into that category.  But I also told Heather that a VC firm’s investment strategy must always be dynamic and that it’s important to be looking ahead to what’s next.  I estimated that we are now spending about 40% of our time looking forward to what might be next.  We don’t really have a good inkling of what that will be yet, but its important to us to be ahead of the curve.  That doesn’t mean that we are ignoring the current explosion in web native technology driven services.  We are still spending about 60% of our time in this area and certainly plan to make a good number of additional investments in this sector.  But hopefully you will start to see some new ideas, terms, and themes develop on this blog and our personal blogs over the coming year.  We are really just starting this process, but here are some early themes we are digging into; spimes, the internet of things, virtual words, avatars, second life, cyworld, natural interfaces, wearable computing, structured messaging, and several others.  We intend to be open about this look ahead.  Most of these ideas and hopefully many more will start emerging in my tags, they may become tags ad even categories on this blog and tags and categories on the other services we use.  And as we look ahead and share what we find with you, we’d love it if you’d share back with comments on this blog and our personal blogs, tagging things for us in delicious, and of course, email, IM, and Skype."
Will Computing Ever Be As Invisible As Electricity,BradUSV,2006-03-20 11:44:14,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Many years ago, I read an article that made a big impression on me. It compared the adoption of information technology to the adoption of electricity. The article noted that, in the late 19th century, when electricity was a novelty, it was a quirky, visible, high maintenance presence in the lives of those adventurous enough to embrace it. When electric motors were first introduced in the household, they were bulky units that most often sat on a big stand in the front hall. The motors powered a belt that turned a shaft mounted over head. Appliances like washing machines were also connected to the shaft by belts. The system was inherited from manufacturing operations that had been powered by water wheels prior to electricity. The proud owners of these early systems would show them off to all their friends, but they also had to be willing to get their hands dirty greasing the shaft, replacing the belts and rebuilding the motors.   The author of the article argued that the information technology business was then in the same stage of development. [I should be pointing to the article, but I don’t remember its title, author or publication - so my web search did not find it.]  I do remember, however, thinking that the article was on to something. Information technology was, at the time, proudly displayed in a glass houses with raised floors. Anyone brave enough to use it in their daily lives had to be willing to maintain it themselves. I also felt certain that there would be a day when, it would be come as invisible to us as electricity. We would stop proudly displaying the infrastructure of IT, and would eventually be blissfully ignorant of how it worked and even who provided the basic infrastructure. How many of us know which national conglomerate owns the local utility that delivers the amps to our home?    I have to admit, however, that at the time, I had no clue how this was going to happen. I suppose I vaguely thought personal computers would get smaller and cheaper, and software would get easier to use, but I was stuck in the then obvious model, in the same way that early users of electricity were stuck in the model of using shafts and belts to distribute electrical power.  I think we are now ning to see just how the quirky, clumsy, high maintenance infrastructure of computing is going to disappear from our lives. Over the next few years, more and more of the services we expect from our computers will be delivered over the web. There are lots of reasons for this but the analogy to the early days of electricity, makes it clear that mass adoption of technology doesn’t happen until the consumer can be completely insulated from the complexity of its implementation.   Google’s success with search is an early indicator of this transition. They presented us with a very simple interface – type what you want in the box and get relevancy ranked links that may have the answer. None of us think much about the huge server infrastructure necessary to do this, algorithms that make it efficient, or the pipes that deliver the answer to your home or office.  Hotmail and Gmail are pure web services. There is slew of calendaring services and network web based file management services popping up. Google’s purchase of the web based word processor, Writely, suggests that word processing may not be far behind. There are also a slew of new services that are native to the web – services like Flickr and Del.icio.us, that are inherently collaborative - services that could not have been implemented as PC software. Some of these services are already accessible anywhere, anytime, on any device, the rest will be soon.  There is a long way to go before the web browser becomes the same reliable standardized interface that the electrical outlet is today. But it now seems possible that the ugly sausage factory of information technology could eventually disappear behind a browser. I cant’ wait. "
Yes but....,BradUSV,2006-03-26 08:56:20,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"In our first ""hello world"" post on this blog, we made the point that the market we operate in is one of the most dynamic markets anywhere. We concluded that it made little sense to have a static investment strategy in such a dynamic environment, so rather than put up a brochure as our web site, we launched a blog because we felt that it made more sense share our conversation.  Fred picked up on this theme with his ""Looking Ahead"" post last week. I completely agree with his premise that we can only succeed in this business if we are anticpating markets, I was concerned that his phrasing suggested that we were moving to quickly to the next thing. Specifically, the reference to our work being focused 60% on web services and 40% on new stuff is misleading. It suggests that we expect something other than web services to emerge shortly which is not really true. All of the stuff Fred mentioned in his post that we are actively pursuing now is delivered to the ultimate consumer as a web service. We are not talking about the demise of web services, we are talking about a generational shift.   We are seeing the end of the obvious first generation web services and are actively looking for what is next, but  the importance of something like avatars is the impact they will have on second generation web services. We think there may be some fundamental shifts in the way the services are used, priced, and delivered as a result of the generational shift. I do not want to down play the extent of the change we expect, but I do want to make clear that we are not looking at materials science or nano for the next big thing.  The second point I would like to make in commenting on Fred's post refers to his casual mention of the tags he is using to organize his thinking on the new areas we are exploring. I think this is a big deal, and it deserves to be called out as a big deal not buried in post about something else. All of us at Union Square Ventures use del.icio.us to find resources and information on the web and to organize and remember those things after we find them. Fred and Charlie are both more conscientious and more prolific with there tagging than I am but each of us has a del.icio.us account and we also share ideas information and resources with ""for"" tags. These are the del.icio.us tags for:fredwilson, for:ceonyc and for:bburnham.  What Fred did in his post, is offer to share these tags. The reality is that these tags have always been shared because that is the default structure in del.icio.us, but we had never called attention to them and suspect that few people, other than us,  paid much attention to them. By mentioning them in his post Fred is offering to share not only the evolution of our thinking here at Union Square Ventures but also to share the raw material that shapes that thinking. He was also inviting all of you to shape that thinking by tagging things in del.icio.us using the tags for:fredwilson, for:ceonyc, for:bburnham, or more simply and perhaps more efficiently, for:usv.  Fred and I agree on the need to ""look ahead"". I also agree that we will learn more from the audience of this blog than they will learn from us, so that sharing our thoughts on the blog and the web resources that inform those thoughts through our tags makes good business sense. We both appreciate the contributions you have made to our thinking to date and look forward to our continued dialogue."
Taking Web Services To The Office,fredwilson,2006-04-13 14:49:19,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Most of the innovation in web services over the past three to four years (what is popularly known as web 2.0) has been focused on the end user as the customer.  We call them consumer facing web services in our firm and they include the services from Yahoo! and Google, blogging tools like Wordpress, Six Apart, Live Journal, Blogger, social networks like MySpace, Facebook, Tribe, LinkedIn, tagging services like Delicious and Furl, photo and video sharing services like Flickr and YouTube, attention aggregators like Digg and Memeorandum, wikis like Wikipedia and Wikicities, and countless other web native services.  These services are changing the way that we use the web to collect information, organize it, republish it, and extend it.  I suppose you could say its a revolution in consumer knowledge management.  Which leads to me to the office or the ""enterprise"".  Esther Dyson observed in a Release 1.0 issue in 2004 (well before web 2.0 was upon us)  that it used to be that technology would start with the goverment (military or space), then move to the enterprise, and end up in the consumer's hands.  But, she said, these days technology starts with the consumer and moves up to the enterprise.  So we think its time for the developers of web services to start thinking about the enterprise.  And we are not alone.  Nicholas Carr wrote a post yesterday wondering if Web 2.0 is ""enterprise ready"".  In that post, Nicholas links to an article in MIT/Sloan's Management Review by Harvard Business School professor Andrew McAfee, called Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration.  In that article Professor McAfeee argues that web 2.0 technologies like blogs, wikis, and group messaging services are perfect for ""spontaneous, knowledge-based collaboration"".  We agree and we have made one investment to date around this theme, in a company called Instant Information that has built a web service featuring many of the most used web 2.0 technologies and techniques, such as RSS, tagging, blogging, wikis, social networking, and information sharing.  The service is called TouchPoint and is focused on the needs of the wall street investment professional.  We hope to make a number of additional investments in enterprise focused web services.  We can learn from what has worked to date with consumers and incorporate those lessons into the design of useful services for enterprises.  You might ask why won't the services that work for consumers today just end up in the enterprise.  We think they will. Certainly we have adopted blogging on the Union Square Ventures website.  We use delicious to share links, we use a jotspot wiki to keep track of all of our deal flow and our investments.  We use social networks like LinkedIn to find candidates for our portfolio companies.  In short, we run our business on web services and we are certain that many other enterprises are doing the same.  But there are times when a service that is ideal for a consumer doesn't work perfectly for an enterprise or a particular industry. In the case of Instant Information, they have added concepts like permissioning and entitlements to TouchPoint so that the wall street investment professional can participate in the sharing of research and other information while maintaining their business model and industry practices.  And then there is the issue of the business model for the web service. Most web services use the Freemium business model in one way or another.  Many enteprises will be more comfortable with a monthly payment than an advertising supported service.  We still think a free component of the business model is critical to get widespread adoption among enterprises.  We think many of these services will be brought into the enterprise by one employee or a small group and then spread virally.  So freemium is still a good way to go when approaching the enterprise with a web service.  If you are building a company that is building or marketing a web service focused on enterprises, we'd certainly like to hear from you."
Why has the flow of technology reversed?,BradUSV,2006-04-14 10:00:50,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Esther and Fred are right that at least in some specific areas like lightweight web services, the flow of technology has reversed. This creates an interesting opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors who,. like us, are on the look out for ways of using services developed for consumers as a framework for business services.   But figuring out which consumer technologies will work in a business context requires taking the analysis a step further. The interesting question is...  why has the flow of  technologies reversed? I think there are two key drivers. The first is the maturity of the information technology infrastructure, and the second is the increasing complexity of information services.  The maturity of the IT infrastructure has dramatically reduced the capital required to create and deliver an innovative web service. When we invested in del.icio.us, Joshua Schacter was already supporitng over 50,000 users on borrowed hardware with less than a $200,000 investment. That was possible because Joshua was able to use the rich development environment that surrounds Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl (the LAMP Stack), and cheap commodity hardware. He also did not need to build a communications network to enable users to get to his service. He could coount on the Internet. Contrast that development effort with the development of the early internet, where expensive mainframe computers were linked together with dedicated communications circuits. That would not have happened without the support of the govenrment.   The second driver is complexity - A friend of ours mentioned last week that by the late 90s the typical enterprise software suite had over 4000 separate features. The most he had avery seen used in any installation was 750. These systems just got too complex for anyone to be able to use all of the features effectively. Contrast that with the current generation of consumer web services. The most obvious example is Google. When it first came on the scene it was a box on the screen into which you typed what you were looking for. Consumer web services tend to do one thing well.  So it is not surprise that business users are ning to capitalize on the rapid pace of innovation on top of the LAMP stack and that business users are rebelling against the uneccassary complexity of the current generation of enterprise software and ning to use tools from their own experince as consumers that are much simpler and easier to use.   All of this suggests that the best enterprise implementations of consumer web services will be lightweight and easy to use.

User Tagging Is Fundamental,fredwilson,2006-05-03 08:36:32,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Earlier this week a fact checker from New York Magazine called me to ask a few questions about Union Square Ventures.  Apparently we are in the next issue in a story about influential technology people in NYC.  She read me a sentence or two about why del.icio.us is an important and influential web service.  I honestly couldn't understand the sentence even though she read it several times over to me.  I told her, ""del.icio.us is important because it allows the users to tag the Internet. It's a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the Internet.""  We made our investment in del.icio.us just over a year ago and it was sold to Yahoo! over four months ago but we still think about it every day.  Not del.icio.us the investment. That has come and gone.  But del.icio.us the service.  Let me repeat a piece of what I told the fact checker from NY Magazine.
User tagging is a fundamental piece of the Internet  Publishers/content creators will tag their content to a degree and they will do more and more of it over time as they realize the importance of meta data in the discovery and consumption of their product.  But ""self tagging"" as we call it will only get the Internet so far.  User tagging is vastly superior to self tagging because it is the consumers who are navigating and trying to find the stuff.  The way they describe it is the same way they will try to find it.  And it's really hard for publishers to figure out all the keywords up front.  In the venture capital business, you often learn more from your investments than they learn from you. I think that was and is clearly the case with del.icio.us. Thanks Joshua."
On Influence,fredwilson,2006-05-08 14:28:13,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"New York Magazine’s cover story this week is on the “Influentials”.  It was nice to see the name of our 18 month old venture capital firm on the list as we’ve been working hard to influence the direction of technology and startups in our home town of New York City.  We are honored, but also a bit humbled, to find ourselves in this company.  But more interesting than the notoriety is the concept of influence vs. power outlined at the start of John Heilemann’s article.    Power in the technology business is housed inside the large companies like Microsoft, Apple, Intel, Google, Yahoo!, Cisco and the venture capital firms with 20 year track records primarily located in Silicon Valley and Boston.  Influence is a different matter entirely. Influence is about ideas that resonate and the communities that spread them. When we think of influential technology people., we like to think of Linus Torvalds, the 37 year old software engineer who has shown the world a better way to develop software, or Craig Newmark, the hacker who put together the world’s largest classifieds service with love, dedication, and no business model.  But no discussion of influence is complete without a discussion of blogging. New York Magazine’s list of over 200 “influencers” contains less than 10 bloggers. I think that’s a mistake. CEOs and politicans may have power, but bloggers are the ones who are influencing thought these days.  Peter Rojas, Micahel Arrington, Robert Scoble, Jason Kottke, Seth Godin, Mike Masnick, Om Malik, Steve Rubel, John Battelle, Dave Winer, Jeff Jarvis, Paul Graham. These are the “influencers” in technology. They spread the “memes” that are shaping the technology business these days.  They may not have the “power” to shape the direction of technology, but the people that have that power are influenced by these people and what shows up on their blogs every day.  Which takes me back to our 18 month old venture capital firm. This blog and our Union Square Sessions events are our attempt to participate in the influential part of the technology and startup ecosystem. We aren’t particularly interested in power. We’ll leave that to the mega companies and mega funds. But influence is something we care deeply about.  We think it will lead to better investments and better returns for our partners."
Introducing Bug Labs,BradUSV,2006-05-09 10:44:59,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"The two things we respect most in an entrepreneur are experience and passion. In entrepreneurship, as in life, they do not always go together. So we are thrilled to be working with Peter Semmelhack,  the founder of Bug Labs, our latest investment. Peter is undeniably experienced. This will be his third start-up. He is also undeniably passionate. For the past year and a half, he has ted every moment he could spare from his family and his day job, and more money than he should have, to the development of a product and service that he believes the world needs.  Here is Peter's description of his new company.  Bug Labs is developing BUG, an open, modular, consumer electronics web services + hardware platform. Designed for the general audience, not just the technically inclined, Bug seeks to bring to the world of hardware gadgets what the Internet, open source, XML and web services have brought to the world of software and media.  Over the last few months, Peter has challenged some of our basic assumptions about the relationship between web services and devices. You can see some of that reassesment in Fred's February post - Web Serivces and Devices.   We agree with Peter that the relationship between web services and devices will become more intimate and more seamless. We share his enthusiasm for this vision and are confident in his ability to make it real."
Advertising to Job Seekers,fredwilson,2006-05-14 09:48:35,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Our portfolio company, Indeed.com, has announced the commercial availability of a cost per click (CPC) advertising system targeting job seekers.  What that means is that advertisers now have a way to reach job seekers directly and pay for those ads on a per click basis (like they do at Google and Yahoo!).  But Indeed has done something pretty unique in rolling out its advertising service.  If you are an employer looking to hire someone, your job listing is most likely already in the Indeed index because Indeed crawls the Internet everyday looking for job listings at the big job boards, the niche job boards, and company websites. But if you want to ""sponsor"" one or more of your listings, you can go to the Indeed advertiser system, specify a price you are willing to pay per click, and set a daily or monthly budget. Your jobs will then also appear as sponsored results above and below the natural search results when someone does a search that returns one of your job listings. In addition, sponsored jobs are displayed across Indeed's network of partner websites.  The Indeed advertising system has been in beta since last year, has about 100 advertisers and is growing every day. The Company launched it officially last week.  Paul Forster, Indeed's CEO, explains that this new advertising system is attractive to employers and other job advertisers for a number of reasons:  1.   Indeed delivers job seekers that are highly targeted to an employer's jobs. This is because Indeed is the most comprehensive search engine for jobs, with unrivalled relevancy algorithms and job search tools.  2.   Indeed's superior targeting leads to very high conversion rates - i.e. clicks to job applications and hires.  Some of our current clients have experienced conversion rates with Indeed that are far higher than any other marketing channel they use.  3.   Sponsoring jobs on Indeed is simple. Unlike search engine keyword advertising, you don't have to pick keywords or write advertising copy.  4.   Compared with buying job postings on a job board, Indeed's advertising system is very cost effective and flexible. You only pay per click and you can alter your bid to drive more or less traffic to your jobs.  In addition to the ability to sponsor jobs, Indeed's CPC ad system offers another unique opportunity. If you are selling something and believe that job seekers are an attractive target market, you can use Indeed's CPC network to target ads against keywords, just like you can on Google or Yahoo!  Think about selling java programming classes or books for java developers to people searching for java programming jobs at Indeed.  Given that Indeed processes over 20,000 searches with word Java in it each month, that's an interesting advertising opportunity in and of itself.  Needless to say, all of us at Union Square Ventures are excited by the launch of Indeed's advertising service. We believe it will allow Indeed to efficiently monetize the millions of job searches that are being done at Indeed.com each month."
What Else Are You Interested In?,fredwilson,2006-05-23 06:21:02,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Our portfolio company, TACODA, is the leader in behavioral targeting. They are working with publishers all over the Internet.  They identify what users are interested in using a ""data tag"" on the publisher's page and then use that data to serve advertising that is more relevant to the user's interests.  It's a win/win/win situation. The publisher gets more revenue per page because the ads are more targeted. The advertiser gets better performing advertising campaigns. And users see ads that they are interested in.  We have been running the TACODA data tag on this blog for several months and we got some interesting data this past weekend that we'd like to share with all of you.  TACODA counted slightly less than 4,000 unique visitors to this blog in April.   And these are the interest areas that you all demonstrated as you surfed the web when you weren't on this blog.  If we were running advertising on this blog, TACODA would use this data to serve up more relevant advertising to you.  "
Replicating Silicon Valley,fredwilson,2006-05-31 09:30:18,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Paul Graham recently wrote an essay on venture capital and startups called How To Be Silicon Valley and I recommend everyone who works in the technology, startup, and venture businesses give it a read. It’s an excellent analysis of the essence of Silicon Valley and how and why it works (and what might be Silicon Valley's weaknesses).  As someone who has participated in building a “Silicon Valley” elsewhere, I found much of Paul's analysis to be spot on. But given that Paul takes a few swipes at New York City, I feel compelled to defend my turf. Please don’t take this post as an attack on Paul’s excellent essay. I am simply trying to educate everyone who sees New York in the same way as Paul does.  The New York Metro area has a significant amount of startup activity but is regularly considered to have a dearth of startups. This is a classic case of misconception at work.  Paul links to a Price Waterhouse survey at the end of his essay that shows the venture capital investment activity in each market in the first quarter of 2006.  In that survey, LA/Orange County comes in third on a dollar basis, just barely beating out the New York Metro area.  But when measured in number of deals, New York is solidly in third place with 58 deals, after Silicon Valley with 245 deals, and Boston with 98 deals. LA/Orange County comes in ninth in terms of the number of deals.  I have been working as a venture capitalist in New York City for 20 years. Over that period of time, I have watched these statistics carefully and for the past 10 years, the New York Metro area has consistently been the third most active venture capital market with about 25% of the activity of Silicon Valley and about 60% of the activity of Boston.  But because the dominant industries in New York are not technology, venture capital, and startups, the startup activity gets lost. New York is seen as a money, media, trade, and real estate town, and it is. I’d venture to guess that technology startups might not even be in the top ten industries in New York.  But New York is hardly a place lacking in nerds as Paul states in his otherwise spot on analysis. This section of Paul’s essay is typical of the stereotype that is just wrong:
If you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with personality. You need a town with the right personality. Nerds are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes from the rest. You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. [5]  What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling. This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York, where people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in Boston, a friend came to visit from New York. On the subway back from the airport she asked ""Why is everyone smiling?"" I looked and they weren't smiling. They just looked like they were compared to the facial expressions she was used to.  If you've lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions come from. It's the kind of place where your mind may be excited, but your body knows it's having a bad time. People don't so much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement. And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable. It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.  Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery. People who like New York will pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the cool people are really cool. A nerd looks at that deal and sees only: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment.  [5] A few startups get started in New York, but less than a tenth as many per capita as in Boston, and mostly in less nerdy fields like finance and media.  I am not going to take the time to respond to this.  I think simply reprinting it will do just fine.  But, Paul is right about what it takes to replicate Silicon Valley:  Nerds
Money
Schools
A Creative Culture
A City With Personality
Youth
Patience  New York has all of these in spades.  We may not have Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, and MIT, but we have Columbia, NYU, Parsons, Brooklyn Tech, Stevens, and a host of other excellent schools that I have now insulted by leaving off the list.  We have plenty of nerds and more are pouring in every day from places like India, China, Israel, Russia, and eastern Europe. We have a culture that is welcoming of alternative languages, cultures, and lifestyles.  As Paul points out, the centers of startup activity are highly correlated to the centers of leftist culture. Why is that? Because entrepreneurs are crazy creative passionate people who are attracted to places where they and their wacky ideas are welcome.  And I can tell you this, they are welcome in New York City, and have been since the day the Dutch formed a city on the tip of the island of Manhattan.  Enough about New York. I am going to finish by pointing out that Paul’s central thesis that Silicon Valley can and will be replicated is spot on. Take a look at the Price Waterhouse survey one more time. There are eleven regions in our country where over $500mm of venture capital will be invested this year. That was Silicon Valley twenty years ago.  It takes time and patience to replicate Silicon Valley. It’s already happened in Boston. And it’s happening in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Boulder/Denver, San Diego, Austin, Dallas, Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, and DC.  These “second tier” venture markets are where I’d be investing if I were a limited partner right now because they have a critical mass of entrepreneurs but not yet a critical mass of quality early stage venture firms. If you can back a quality early stage venture firm in one of these markets, I bet they will do very well over the next ten years as Silicon Valley gets replicated all over our country.  Paul’s next essay is about whether you can replicate Silicon Valley overseas. He gave me a preview of it over the weekend and it's now online. It's also an excellent analysis.  Thanks Paul for putting these thoughts out there. It’s about time that people starting realizing that Silicon Valley doesn’t have a lock on startup mojo."
How Does Indeed Make Money?,fredwilson,2006-06-05 05:43:39,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"A number of people have asked me this question in response to my post on Indeed from several weeks ago.  Fortunately Paul Forster, CEO of Indeed, has laid out the basics of Indeed's sponsored jobs offering in this post on Blog Indeed.  If you take a look at this Indeed results page, you can see what Paul is talking about.
  The listing with the light blue background at the top of the search results is a sponsored advertisement. The sponsored listings on the right sidebar are additional sources of revenue.  It's a very natural revenue model.  As Paul explains in his post:  The advertiser only pays for clicks on the sponsored advertisements, while clicks from the same jobs in our natural results continue to be free. Job seeker referrals are highly qualified because sponsored jobs are ranked by relevance as well as by bid. Conversion rates - from sponsored clicks to applications - are also extremely high because the advertisement landing pages are the individual job descriptions on the advertisers’ own websites.  Thanks for that explanation Paul. We are enthusiastic about Indeed's revenue system because, like the PPC systems invented by Overture and Google, it is a very natural extension of the search experience and advertisers have shown that they are happy to pay for performance."
Etsy,fredwilson,2006-06-05 18:12:34,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"When it comes to online commerce, we are big fans of community and marketplaces. In the age of “search for the lowest price” retailing, there are few differentiating features that can deliver a sustainable advantage in online commerce.  We have not found anything in the online commerce area that has interested us until earlier this year when we met Rob Kalin and his co-founders. Last July they launched Etsy to serve the needs of artists who wanted a place to sell their handmade goods.  In the past 10 months, Etsy has grown by word of mouth to over 10,000 artists selling their handmade goods to over 40,000 buyers. Today, there are over 100,000 listings on Etsy, every single one of them handmade and available for sale. And over 70,000 items have been sold on Etsy at a sell-through rate that beats eBay.  In nine months, with no marketing, a few press mentions, just one mention on Techcrunch (in November of 2005), and plenty of word of mouth, Etsy has grown to be one of the top 4,000 domains on the web according to Alexa.  What we like about Etsy is its marketplace model, the vibrant community, and a truly unique shopping experience that is ideally suited to artistic goods. Etsy feels so right for the market it is serving.  We also like Etsy’s global reach. Click on the geolocator and go shopping for handmade goods in Korea or New Zealand. Buy directly from the artist with no middleman.  The business model is straight out of eBay - listing fees and a small piece of the . But Etsy charges significantly less and has a simpler fee structure than eBay. If you are an artist and want to start selling on Etsy, it is quite simple. Go to the List An Item page, sign up, and post your works for sale.  This is a low friction marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact without overhead. But it’s also a fanatic community where users flag goods that aren’t handmade and get them taken down quickly. It’s the kind of place where one artist seller will build a logo for another’s store just because they want to help buid the marketplace.  If you go to Etsy and I suggest you do, you’ll see some of the most advanced flash work we have ever seen, done by Etsy team member Jared Tarbell. It is certainly the most advanced flash we've seen for a commerce oriented application. It is that use of flash and the use of the picture as the defining object of the service (flickr for commerce?), that creates the unique shopping experience.  We are looking forward to the launch of the new version of the service which is coming shortly. We’ve seen it and it will take the shopping model much further with scalability to address the growing number of participants in the Etsy marketplace.  Last week Union Square Ventures participated in a small “friends of Etsy” round of financing that will allow Etsy to launch the redesigned service, hire a few people, and keep growing.  This round was put together by Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield, founders of Flickr, and includes Joshua Schachter, the founder of Delicious, and Albert Wenger, the former President of Delicious. These four people have been advising Rob and his colleagues for the past year and we feel very fortunate to be part of this excellent group of advisors and investors."
Why We Admire Craigslist,BradUSV,2006-06-09 10:09:51,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Craig Newmark came by last week and spent an hour with us and the leaders of several of our portfolio companies.    I kicked off the conversation by describing how Charlie, who was short two softball players for a game last Monday, posted on Craigslist that morning and by game time that afternoon had two ringers and a number of alternates lined up. I was astounded by that kind of liquidity - Craig, characteristically, smiled cryptically and said that he was happy to hear that the list was useful.  It was a broad ranging conversation where we talked about the challenges of managing a ""community"" the unusual business model of offering it for free until your users insist that you charge them, and the remarkable efficiency of user generated web services.   I spent most of the time trying to ascribe motive, direction, and strategy to the choices Craig made in the eleven years since he started the list. Craig refused to take the bait, insisting, as he always has, that he, Jim and the rest of the 21 people at Craigslist are reacting to the community, not acting on a plan.  So with little help from Craig, I am going to take a shot at why we admire Craigslist.  We admire Craigslist because it is a remarkable combination of scale, relevance, and efficiency. Craigslist serves 200 (soon to be 300) cities, in 35 countries, where is presents 8 million listings to 10 million users, every month. Its relevance to any specific user is, in part, due to the network effect of this scale, but it is also driven by many subtle choices in interface, utilities, and business model. These design decisions, which Craig would argue, were driven by his need in the early days to support a growing number of users with few servers and no employees, are also the key to Craigslist's efficiency. Craigslist still employs only 21 people. For a system of its scale, I can think of no other service that comes even close to that level of efficiency.  Many of the web services we admire seem to have this combination of scale, relevance and efficiency. Google, del.icio.us, and Last FM, come to mind. They all get there in slightly different ways, but they all get there;  leading me to wonder if getting this combination of things right is the critical success factor for web services. "
Oddcast,ceonyc,2006-06-13 11:15:47,0,0,[],"Last week, we closed an investment in Oddcast, our eighth portfolio company and Brad will be joining the Oddcast board of directors.  Oddcast is the leading developer of web-based avatars for businesses and consumers.  For some time now, we have been thinking about the relationship between identity and web services.  Combining the two makes our digital experience more relevant, as we see with TACODA’s success in the behavioral targeting model, or even as we express ourselves as a firm through this blog, rather than by putting up a boilerplate company website.   Software vendors, mobile carriers, video game publishers, etc. are all trying to create a unique experience—one that reflects the look, feel, and preferences that a user wants.  Some, like MySpace, have put the tools of self-expression in the hands of the user.  They realize that creation of passionate users involves the sense of ownership that comes from user contribution to the product.  A ringtone and a skin, in the same way, make it ""my phone"" versus ""a phone"" and being able to put oneself in as the video game quarterback of the Giants makes it “my Madden football”.  The ability for a consumer to “create’ or to at least customize their own service is an increasingly important requirement for consumer facing web services.
 
Self expression in content and services creates a two way street.  The explosion of blogs, shows us that media is not just about broadcast.  More and more content, commentary, and feedback is being generated everyday as digital publishing tools gain mainstream adoption.  People who were previously just consumers of media are now publishers and remixers who want to express their own personal views.  Through these means, and by growing participation in social networks, users are expressing their identity and presence online in more intentional ways.  Whereas this digital presence has started to appear haphazardly in search results and in a disaggregated way on multiple social network silos, users are now looking for ways to integrate and manage their digital persona.   Marketers can leverage personalization in order to create stronger direct ties to their customers and potential customers.  In a digital world, brand control is tenuous at best, and is ineffective in the face of growing consumer leverage.  Instead, by allowing consumers to express themselves in terms of the products and entertainment they consume, marketers will benefit more from the unprecedented speed and virality of grassroots, word of mouth marketing, as well as behavioral metadata.  
 
We believe the increasing popularity of Avatars is one of several indicators of the consumer’s willingness to invest time and energy to create a digital persona. When we surveyed the market, we came to the conclusion that Oddcast had the most lightweight, flexible and capable web-based avatar implementation.    Oddcast built an attractive business offering avatars to businesses, large and small. We are thrilled to be working with this experienced team to build from this foundation to deliver avatars to consumers and to making those avatars available wherever those consumers are on the web and on the mobile devices in their pockets.

Union Square Sessions 2 - Public Policy and Innovation,BradUSV,2006-06-16 10:53:36,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Yesterday we hosted a group of academics, policy professionals, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs for a conversation about public policy and its impact on innovation. We are very grateful to everyone who took a day out of their busy schedules to help us explore this issue.  The policy professionals in the room argued that the outcome of the current debate on network neutrality, the broadcast flag, and the proposed extension of the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DCMA) will have a big impact on the opportunity for entrepreneurs to innovate in large and important areas of the economy. The entrepreneurs discounted the threat of innapropriate policy by reminding us of their history of being able to find opportunity in a wide range of regulatory regimes. The venture capitalists pointed out that they were accountable to their investors to deliver a return and that it was easier for them to meet that obligation by shifting their investment focus than it was to fix innapropriate regulation.  By the end of the day, the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs better understood, not only the risks to their current businesses of innapropriate regulation, but also the degree to which enlightened regulation and government sponsorship had created opportunity for innovation in the past in this country and continued to do so in Europe and the Far East.  At the same time, the proposals offered by the academics and policy professionals began to reflect a better appreciation of the irrepressible optimisim of the entrepreneur, and the mercenary logic of the venture capital business model.  This diverse group was brought together by a shared interest in innovation. We did not come out of the day with a consensus on any aspect of the debate, but we all came away with a much better sense of what was at stake and some understanding of the range of potential solutions.  You will be able to follow the conversation yourselves when we put up the transcript in a few days. We will also try to highlight a few of the insights here over the next couple of weeks. In the meantime you can get a sense of the participants by looking at the photos taken at the event by our friend Mark Andres.

Sessions,BradUSV,2006-06-29 15:36:52,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"It took a little longer than we would have liked but the transcript of our June 15th Sessions event is now up on the Sessions Wiki. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find it.  Or if you'd rather, this is a direct link to the transcript.  Jonathan Taplin took me to task early on for suggesting that ubiquitous connectivity was a given.       "" I'd just like to kind of object in a friendly way to your initial supposition, which was that we're living a world of commoditized infrastructure, and ubiquitous connectivity, and I quite frankly think that's not a given.  I think we do live in an -- at least in the United States, we live in a telecom duopoly, and clearly the notion that for me a lot of the great business stories in venture capital in the last five years were built on that basis, i.e. obviously Google could never have existed without Linux.  If they obtained server licenses on 800,000 processors, their business model would look very different than it does now.  And if they hadn't had access to all this dark fiber and all that... ubiquitous connectivity.
          But the day when AT & T or Comcast starts changing different levels of prices for different access to a network to a company like Google, their business will change overnight, and that could completely screw the model, and could screw the model of any new start-up that wants to start serving content or any other application into these networks.""  Jon's comment launched us into a long and healthy debate on the Net Neutrality proposals before Congress.  Tom Evslin pointed out that this is not just about whether or not Google pays an RBOC more that Yahoo for better service, it changes the very nature of the net.      "" if you have to examine every packet on the internet, then you don't have the internet anymore.  Not only because you slow the packets down but also, because now the networks become application aware, and we get back to that wasteland that's the telephone network where you can't introduce a new innovation unless the network becomes aware of it"".   Tom also shed some light on why the RBOCs and Cable Operators are likely to try to reach up into the applications layer to extract a tax for carraige across their networks. ""they've [the RBOCS] made an enormous investment in replicating the cable model as a new revenue source, since VOIP is hollowing out the profits on their voice model.  But they converged with an obsolete model.  The cable model's about to fall apart.  The content providers are bypassing the fixed distribution system and going directly to the web.  So if you don't want to face another hundred million dollars in write-offs - if you're those companies, how do you slow that down?  You break the internet, that would slow that down"".   Larry Lessig brought the conversation home by describing how the duopoly that controls the local loop is likely to dampen innovation.     ""there's dynamic here that I think we need to focus on, and that dynamic happens inside a venture capitalist's board room, and the venture capitalists sit there and they  say, ""Well, we know in five years when this product is done, there's going to be an infrastructure where one or two people call the shots about what runs on the network.  And in that world, do we think that our product is going to have a shot?""
          ""Now some products will because they won't threaten the business model  of the one or two entities that control the network, but the whole point is that the extent that you got business models that aren't really in the interest of the network, the venture capitalist I would think would say, ""No, the risk is too high, so, therefore, we're not going to be investing in these products,"" and therefore, when you point at things that will be the competitors of the network, they won't exist because they won't have had the investment to actually make them exist"".  Gigi Sohn wondered why, given what was at stake, the tech community was so under represented in the lobbying circles in Washington    ""But I think the bigger question is this, you have the incumbent regulated companies, the Bells, Cable, Hollywood, the recording industry investing unbelievable amounts of money in Washington.  I think I read somewhere that the Bells are spending like $1,000,000 a day on advertising and lobbyists.  They have bought up the Republicans and the Democrats. The tech community, which is our ally I would say on almost 100 percent of everything we do, I don't know if they invest a 10th of that""  We went on to have a spirited debate on the risk to innovation posed by a loss of net neutrality. We talked at length about why entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have not historically invested money or energy to influence the debate in Washington.   Later in the day we tackled other policy issues that impact the pace of innovation including Patents, Copyrights, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act and The Broadcast Flag. There were a lot of great insights. We will try to pull a few out over the next couple of weeks, but if these are areas that interest you, I'd encourage you to read through the transcript yourself."
A Bittersweet Moment,fredwilson,2006-07-07 08:37:09,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"It is with mixed emotions that we bid Charlie O'Donnell goodbye.  As Charlie explains on his personal weblog, he is leaving Union Square Ventures at the end of next week to join our portfolio company Oddcast in the newly created position of Director of Consumer Products.  It seems like just yesterday that I wrote this post on my personal weblog explaining how we met Charlie, how we got to know him, and how we decided to hire him. It's a great story about networking, blogging, and business.  Charlie was our first two-year analyst and he has defined the role and set a bar that is pretty high. He has injected a part of his person, attitude, energy, and intellect into our firm and we are richer for it. We will also miss having him around because he's a great person.  That said, we are thrilled to see him go out and join an early stage company, particularly a company we are invested in.  It's an excellent outcome for him and we are thrilled that one of our portfolio companies will be able to reap the benefits of his skills, attitude, and energy the way we did.  So it's a bittersweet moment for us at Union Square Ventures. We wish Charlie well and look forward to working with him for a long time to come."
Through the Looking Glass into the Net Neutrality Debate,BradUSV,2006-07-11 10:19:23,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"There is this wonderful Alice in Wonderland quality to the current Net Neutrality debate.  Listening to the rhetoric, one s to feel that up is, in fact, down and down is up. The innovative high growth applications companies like Amazon, Ebay, and Google are are asking the government to impose a regulatory regime on the net to ensure that no application is discriminated against and the stodgier infrastructure companies like Verizon and TIme Warner Cable are asking the government to stay out of way and let the free market decide how access to their pipes is priced.  This mind bending transposition only sorts itself out if you bring the prospect of a broadband wireless local loop into the discussion. In the debate about Philadelphia or San Francisico's wireless proposals, both sides resort to their true colors. The infrastructure companies complain to their friends in the local regulatory bodies that they need to be protected from the competitive pressure of cheap access and the applications layer companies are enthusiastic supporters of a new competitor providing an alternative local loop. This makes it clear that Net Neutrality debate is really about whether the local loop is a natural monopoly, if it will always be so, and, if it is a natural monopoly, whether it should be regulated to ensure the public good.  By framing the issue this way I do not mean to over simplify it. We spent an entire morning discussing Net Neutrality at our last Sessions event. If you have an interest in the area, I would encourage you to dig through the transcript but in the meantime I will try to highlight some of the key insights that came out of the discussion.   Jon Taplin argued that the local loop will be a duopoly controlled by the cable operators and the telcos. He beleives that a two way six megabit is the minimal level of service we will accept and that wireles will not deliver that.   Chris Putala of Earthlink made the point that the threat of wireless access is one way to get carraige on the Telco and Cable companies pipes.       We may be able to create some leverage which through --    we're playing a lot in the WiFi space building clouds over cities, and I think there's probably more of a complimentary aspect, because I don't necessarily see us getting to six megs symmetrical.  The initial roll out we'll be doing will be one meg symmetrical.  It's important.  It brings a lot of applications, but I really think that much of that is about negotiating leverage to get on to, you    know, one or both of the pipes into the house.  Fred made the point that as venture capitalists and entrepreneurs we have this irrepressible enthusiasm for innovation and think that we can innovate our way around almost anything    does the sheer force of innovation and Moore's Law and the fact that bits are bits at the end of the day allow us to develop    other technologies and other approaches to do with a one megabit network -- to create close to the same experience on one megabit network what people get in Korea on a 30 megabit network?  Can we use things like peer to peer, compression and other approaches, you know, essentially push technologies and other approaches to effectively get services deployed which appear ultimately to have the same utility to consumers as you would get in a symmetric 30 megabit network?  Can we engineer around this problem?  Laurie Racine pointed out that even if Fred is right that we can innovate around the duopoly of the cable companies and telcos, it does not mean that consumers are being well served.    I think we're talking about defensive innovation as opposed to really creative innovation.  And what's happening outside this country, without the pressures on innovators and VCs because of the structures that say are in Korea or other places,  allows for innovation to take place without parameters.  In other words, without edges that are essentially closed. And in this country, what we're seeing now actually is an innovative structure that is reactive, and there's a big difference.  Laurie was talking here about innovation as the applications layer service providers think about it. It is another aspect of the through the looking glass character of this debate that the pipe companies are claiming to be the champions of innovation.  They argue that imposing a regulatory regime that eliminates their ability to price differently for different services would make it impossible for them to ""innovate"" at the infrastructure layer but here they blur the distinction between innovation and infrastructure deployment. Most of the tecnhologies they are deploying were invented years ago, as is evident from the fact that in other parts of the world like Korea, Japan, and many parts of Europe, they all ready have more than six megabit speeds in their local loops.   There is an open question on whether the cable and telephone companies can charge enough for open bandwidth access that they can fund a ""traditional"" broad band build out. Even if they could deploy fiber in wealthy urban neighbor hoods, it is unclear that that they would be able to do it in poor rural ones. But these are deployment issues not innovation issues. The pipe providers could theoretically invest in developing innovative ways to provide inexpensive wireless broadband services to both urban and rural communities but they have huge sunk costs in their current wired networks that could be obsoleted by successful wireless implementations so no one expects them to agressively invest in those technologies.  In the end, the entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, policy people and academics that attended our Sessions event all agreed that allowing the telcos and the cable companies to exploit their current natural monopolies in the local loop to extract a tax from applications layer service providers and/or to control the users experience of those services by speeding up or slowing down specific services would hurt innovation and would not be in the best interest of consumers. We could not agree on the degree of risk or on a specific solution to the problem.   It is a measure of the profound impact the internet is having on our society that the Net Neutrality ammendment to the telecommunications bill has fractured the traditional voting blocks in Congress. We are living through a period of transition as fundamental as the shift from an agrarian to an industrial society. We should not be surprised that we sometimes feel that we are gazing through the looking glass. We should also not be surprised that there are no easy answers and that the ideas with the most promise are not easily classified. The solutions we arrive at are likely to involve some aspects of traditional regulation, some market mechanisms, and some technical and business model innovation. All of us are going to have to step away from the easy orthodoxies that allowed us to navigate the relatively stable waters of the industrial economy and consider solutions to this brand new set of problems in a new light. It is not going to be easy, but there is a lot at stake, and it is worth doing."
Do Patents Encourage or Stifle Innovation?,fredwilson,2006-07-07 14:46:57,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"At our recent Union Square Sessions event, we discussed three primary topics relating to public policy and innovation; net neutrality, copyrights, and patents. In this post, I'll try to summarize the patent discussion and highlight some of the most interesting points that were made. If you'd like to read the transcript of the entire patent discussion, it's available on our wiki for download here.  I started out the conversation referencing recent blog posts made by Brad Feld and me where we both asked the question - are patents helping or hurting innovation?        DSC_0846     Originally uploaded by USV. Irwin Gross stepped up to the plate and argued forcefully that patents aren't the problem. He believes that problem is that there isn't a liquid marketplace for patents to be easily valued and licensed. He said:

There's an awful lot of industry innovation and traditional IT innovation going on and being financed    today, and it's a shame that we don't have a mechanism for enabling the trades of rights of -- the notion that because s are complex, we should abolish the property, right, which is sort of the argument against patents, has always seemed to me to be both rational and wrong.  Really the answer in a very    substantial way is to come up with and innovate, as the Creative Commons folks    have, come up with ways to lower the information costs.  Come up with valuation models that make sense.  They need to be based on first principle. Byron Scholls once told me that the Black Scholls Model isn't widely used because it's right.  It's right because it's widely used.  And very similar arguments can be made about the way the copyrights -- intellectual property rights generally, to the extent they're transacted in, are valued. So the argument here or discussion that we were having centers on the question of whether it's a policy matter or matter of private innovation, we ought to be working to create a market -- a market impact rights that enables transparency in , that enables meaningful evaluation so people don't feel like they're being held hostage, but that as a result, creates a wide range of s in patents.  Irwin actually made this argument to me in a conversation late one night at the D conference and I've been fascinated by it since. However, most of the participants at Sessions weren't buying it.  Albert Wenger and Peter Semmelhack both blamed it on the patent process.  Albert said:
      DSC_0465     Originally uploaded by USV. But I don't think that's why the system falls down today. It's that the process of patenting takes too freaking long and is too broad by a patent office that gets only a quarter of the patent fee and the rest is diverted to other government activities, completely overloaded examiners that get rail roaded, and you know this from your practice, because they get some extra bonus fees if they close out a patent, or if they deny the patent.  So they'll deny the patent so they can then issue them.  It's a ridiculous system.  So I think the problem is not with patents, it's with the process by which they're getting issued.  And you wind up with these things that take 60 months to issue.        DSC_0437     Originally uploaded by USV. Peter followed several minutes later with this:
Copyrights are sort of easy, because I can write a book and I can put a copyright on it and I got a copyright.  Patents, I have to go through the gauntlet of saying here's some arbitrary third party telling me that this is unique or not. Half the time they don't know what they're talking about, and I'm being generous.   Peter and Albert are both entrepreneurs who face the issue of what to do about patents and are incredibly frustrated by the choices they have. Dave Morgan is another entrepreneur who is frustrated by the patent system. Dave argued that the lack of clarity, transparency, and good faith in the system is equally problematic:

      DSC_0841     Originally uploaded by USV. It's lack of clarity.  I mean, in copyright protect  and copy, and in most cases you know that someone owns something, and you can tell that a piece of that got over here, but the problem in the patent world is that you don't know necessarily -- like particularly in business methods and around technology, you don't know actually what something -- whether something actually infringes or doesn't infringe, and I think that the challenge for an    entrepreneur, for start-up companies is you have companies out there that are    taking patents and reusing them very destructively or very offensively.  So    someone will get some arcane -- someone will buy or find some arcane little    patent, and then will combine with a law firm, and then you'll see 100 letters go out and they'll find five companies that they'll sue strategically and work there way up. Right now, I just ran into one where a company, Nielsen Netratings, basically claimed the use of all Java Script, and they've also gotten $20,000,000 in several settlements, and what they did was attack a company in the S1 process.  Well, with what injunctive relief could do to a company that's in an S1 process, writing a check for $15,000,000 over several years was worth it to get the 80 million dollar check out of the S1.  Habib Kairouz reminded everyone that while patents may be problematic in the information technology business (Brad Feld's point in his post), they are critical to the funding environment in the biotechnology business:        DSC_0664     Originally uploaded by USV. But the real question is whether patents are actually helping innovation or helping the lawyers, and I would argue that in the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology industry, is absolutely helping innovation, and we wouldn't even have the biotech industry ..... It's not just a FDA problem.  It's actually you have to take the drug through pre-clinicals. You have to put them in a limited   number of people.  You have to make sure it's safe before you disseminate it.  It's $100,000,000 with a 10 percent chance of approval at the end of the day. No one in their right mind would ever fund something like this, unless it had a pot of gold at the end that if I do it for 10 companies, nine of them would go bankrupt, but that one company out there would make the return. So the bottom line is that there wouldn't be investment in the industry if it wasn't for the patent office.  My takeaway is that the patent system has value, particularly in industries where there are lengthy development cycles and high capital costs, but in the information technology industry, I see very little value to the patent process and system. Maybe we can get to a liquid market in patents, but only if there were some forcing mechanism.  As I said at one point in the discussion:But the problem with all of that -- and I thought a lot    about this since you sort of posed this to me a couple weeks ago -- I think we    would all welcome liquid marketplace in intellectual property around patents,    but the reality is whether somebody -- whether it's IBM or Nielsen or an    operating business as opposed to a financial entity owns a patent, they don't actually care that much about extracting the financial value of that patent.  They care about the operating advantages that it gives them in the marketplace to operate a monopoly.  So there's no incentive for them to license that patent.  They frankly would rather not license that patent. They would rather make it such that everybody not compete with them.  It was a great conversation. Again, if you'd like to read the entire patent conversation (it's only 16 pages), you can download the patent discussion transcript here."
We need an independent invention defense to minimize the damage of aggressive patent trolls,BradUSV,2010-01-11 16:49:50,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"  Almost a third of our portfolio is under attack by patent trolls. Is it possible that one third of the engineering teams in our portfolio unethically misappropriated technology from someone else and then made that the basis of their web services?  No! That's not what is happening. Our companies are driven by imaginative and innovative engineering teams that are focused on creating social value by bringing innovative new services to market.   Our companies are being attacked by companies that were not even in the same market, very often by companies they did not even know existed.   The problem is that the patent system has fallen way behind the pace of innovation, especially in information technology. Originally designed to protect the brilliant independent inventor of a better mousetrap, the patent system has been stretched to be applied to software. Software is a language and like any language, it can be very abstract. Everyone applying for a patent pays a lawyer to take their invention and render it into the broadest, most abstract language they can slip through the patent office. A mouse trap is a mouse trap, but a method of allowing one piece of software to talk to another (the generalized language often used to describe a software system) can be almost anything, and can, if approved, impact markets the original inventor could never even have imagined.   Maybe there are some markets where you could make a credible argument that someone who creates a foundational piece of technology should be able to control all of the downstream innovation that follows. Perhaps this can be argued in the case of pharmaceuticals. I think it is a stretch even there, but in information technology, I have never seen a software invention that is foundational in that way. Much more often, I see cases where a naïve patent examiner is hoodwinked into approving a patent on the software equivalent of the word ""the"" and when the patent later falls into the hand of a troll, it becomes the platform to systematically extort as broad a segment of the market as they can.   Trolls go after the smaller companies first. They pick on startups because undercapitalized small companies cannot afford to be ideological. When faced with the prospect of extensive legal fees and a huge distraction, they do the pragmatic thing - they settle.  The troll can accept less from a startup because the troll can later argue the startup has a small market share and a limited ability to pay. A smaller settlement does not preclude larger settlements with bigger players later. In a side note, one troll accepted services from our portfolio company in lieu of cash because the troll could not technically do the thing that our company was accused of copying so we are providing them with the capability. The irony there kills me. It feels a little like being forced to dig your own grave before being shot.   The trolls then use the money extorted from young startups to fund the more expensive and ambitious cases against larger more established companies with deeper pockets. These folks have more to lose but they also have more resources to defend themselves.  I don't often think about the plight of large companies but this attack has a direct impact on young companies.  Established companied often grow by buying innovative young companies. Trolls like to attack a startup in the process of selling to an established company. By pouncing after the merger is announced, but before it closes, they hope to extort a quick cash settlement. Even if they are polite enough to wait, the problem is that innovation is under attack. Going after companies who have bought young technology companies will have a chilling effect. If that trend is allowed to continue, it will have an impact on startups ability to get funded.  We will all lose a huge engine of innovation.  So what has this got to do with an independent invention defense?  Simple, as I said up front, I know of no case where the engineers in one of our companies were aware of the patents that are now being used to attack them.  The moral rightness of this screams at me. If, as an engineer focused on solving a problem, I happened to come up with an idea that is in some way similar to yours, then that in itself should suggest that it was obvious and not patentable. Unfortunately, that does not really help. There, the burden of proof is still on the startup and it is still smarter to settle than to burn precious capital on a defense.  If, on the other hand,  the troll was required to show the startup had some prior knowledge of their technology, the burden would be shifted to the attacker, and this blatant abuse would come to a grinding halt. If you believe as I do that innovation is key to social progress, please support patent reform. It is a complicated issue, but an independent invention defense is an obvious place to start.

Looking For The Right Person,fredwilson,2006-07-12 18:22:19,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We recently posted the news that our analyst Charlie O'Donnell is leaving us to join one of our portfolio companies. We are now actively looking for someone to fill his position.  We noticed while working with del.icio.us that their best hires were part of the extended del.icio.us community long before anyone in the company met them. The del.icio.us team first became aware of these people through their work on the web. Several had created useful  del.icio.us extensions that demonstrated their understanding of the service and its potential. So when faced with challenge of filling Charlie's shoes, we thought we would reach out to see if there was someone out there who is already part of the Union Square Ventures community because they follow this blog, but who might now want to become an active member of our team.  The analyst position at Union Square Ventures is a two year rotational assignment. We hope that after working with us, that person would move, as Charlie has, to one of our portfolio companies or pursue an advanced degree.  The primary responsibility of the analyst at Union Square Ventures is to help us manage the day to day activities of the firm including,   * Deal Process Management
* Due Diligence
* Research/Market Awareness
* Limited Partner Interface
* Quarterly and Annual Reporting  The position requires technical skills including light web development skils and fluency in web services, blogging, excel, word, and powerpoint. But we also expect our analyst to be an integral part of the investment process, and someone who can bring the perspective of a potential user to our evaluation of web-based services.  So while skills are important, we are also looking for a candidate who has a passion for the transformative potential of the Internet. We expect that the successful candidate will be ""net native"" in the sense that they use web services daily in both a personal and a professional capacity. We assume that this person already has an online presence such as a service or site they have created, a social network profile, a personal homepage, or a blog.  If you are interested in being considered for this postition, please leave a comment to this blog post with your name, a link to your online presence, and a way to reach you. Please do not send us an email or a resume.  We can not promise to respond directly to every inquiry. We do promise to follow the links and to get in touch if your passion for the Internet and your facility with web services is expressed through your online presence."
Our Focus,BradUSV,2006-08-06 03:49:26,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"A year ago when we first re-launched our web site as a blog, we did so because we felt that the environment was too volatile for a fixed investment thesis. Instead we suggested that our thesis evolves in a dialogue with the market and that it made more sense for us to publish the conversation.  Over the past year we have realized that some of the characteristics we look for in an investment opportunity have remained constant even as the market has continued to evolve. We though we would list those characteristics on separate posts over the next few days with an eye to reexamining them.   The first constant is our focus:  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENABLED SERVICES  We invest in information technology. We do not invest in energy, biotech, materials science, or nanotechnology. Information technology is the world we know. We believe that when it comes to start up investing, success is dependent on understanding the forces shaping a developing market more than knowing the trade of investing. That conviction keeps us close to the markets we know best.  Within the broad category of information technology, our current focus is on IT enabled services. We rarely invest in companies that sell technology to others. We would prefer to invest in companies that use technology internally to deliver a service to other companies or to consumers. Google hires lots of PHD computer scientists who build lots of information technology systems but they sell very little technology directly. Instead they use this very sophisticated technology internally to deliver deceptively simple services. Our portfolio company TACODA began life licensing targeting technology to media companies, but really took off when it began use its technology internally to deliver behaviorally targeted advertising for marketers in partnership with media companies.   We focus on IT enabled services because we believe that commoditized (cheap) IT infrastructure and ubiquitous connectivity have only begun to disrupt large markets like media, entertainment, marketing, information services, and financial services. Where there is disruption there is opportunity for start ups.   We also believe that as the technology industry matures, it becomes more difficult to build value in a business that sells technology directly to others. I spoke to an investor over the weekend that put it this way… “50% of my portfolio is in communication equipment. It has become very hard to make money there. There are only 5 companies to sell to. They increasingly demand really substantial innovation before they even agree to evaluate a new box. That innovation requires a huge capital investment. Then before they agree to put it in their network, they take you around to Cisco, Nortel and Alcatel and tell them to OEM the box because I am not going to buy it from a start up. By the time the buyer negotiates their discount , and the distribution partner takes their pound of flesh, there is nothing left for the start up or its investors.”.  By comparison, information technology enabled services are more capital efficient and can, if they have a compelling value proposition and/or a great search engine optimization strategy, avoid the tax of a distribution partner by reaching customers directly over the web.  Finally, because the market for IT enabled services is still in its infancy, the business models are not well understood, and therefore the economics of financing these businesses have not been codified. By contrast, the model for financing core technology companies is so well understood (and so stable) that text books have been written about it. This means that more capital tends to compete for deals that fit that model bidding up valuations especially in comparison with early stage IT enabled services deals.   We focus on IT enabled services because, 1) it is a market we know, 2) the market is still in its infancy and 3) there is less competition.  Thoughtful people have questioned the attractiveness of IT enabled services as an investment opportunity because of concerns about the size of the opportunity and the defensibility of new services. These are legitimate concerns. We will describe how we try to identify scalable and defensible businesses in the next couple of posts."
Potential to change the structure of markets,BradUSV,2006-08-08 14:04:20,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We invest in IT enabled services that have the potential to change the structure of markets. We see many plans that claim to incrementally improve the efficiency of an existing company or market. Some of these have pretty compelling economics, but in our view the upside here is capped by the structure of the existing company or market. We would prefer to invest in a business that at least has the potential to change the structure of market. Google is again a convenient, if over used, example. In their best years, the major TV networks book revenue from 300 to 400 customers. Analysts estimate that Google has more than 600,000 customers. They have fundamentally restructured their part of the advertising industry.   It does not surprise us that the real leverage of an entrepreneurial enterprise comes from participating in, or exploiting fundamental change in a market. Those of us who worked in the information technology business in the mid 90s remember the emergence of the enterprise software business. At the time, many departments had automated some of their functions using information technology. The enterprise software folks came along with the promise of integrating those islands of information. The best implementations, however, did not just link the existing systems and business processes; they launched major enterprise re-engineering efforts. The vendors and consultants who installed enterprise software argued correctly that the only way to fully capitalize on these systems was to restructure the enterprise to exploit the new integrated data asset and enhanced information liquidity. We believe that we are seeing the same phenomenon play out today; but at the market level.   Yahoo, eBay, Amazon, Google and MySpace have all, in some way, restructured their markets. We believe that despite the success of this first generation of web services, the market is still in its infancy, and that liquidity of information on the net is shortening market cycles making it likely that the next generation of web services will have an equally disruptive impact on this still very young market structure."
Information Technology Leverage,BradUSV,2006-08-09 14:08:13,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Not all IT enabled services businesses get the same value from their IT investment. We look for companies that have substantial technology leverage. When we make this point in conversation with an entrepreneur, it is usually enough to say ""think Craigslist not Webvan"".   Webvan was a huge and expensive grocery distribution center with a website. The vast majority of their capital was invested in areas that had very little IT leverage. Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt and say that their internal IT systems were state of the art, and substantially reduced the cost picking, packing and shipping groceries, it was still an expensive and ultimately manual operation.   Craigslist is at the other extreme. They provide a classified service in 300 markets with something like 10 million unique visitors and 9 million posts each month with only 21 employees. The secret is, of course, that Craigslist coordinates the activities of its users and depends on them to post ads and monitor abuse.   Del.icio.us curates links in the same way, by coordinating the activity of their users. Social navigation and user generated content coordinated by an efficient web service are good examples of IT leverage but there are others; crawling, and collaborative filtering are two that come to mind.  So we look for substantial information technology leverage. We find it often in services that coordinate the activities of their users, but we also find it in innovative uses of information technology that have no social component."
Defensibility,BradUSV,2006-08-10 14:10:32,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Historically the defensibility of information technology companies has been based on intellectual property - usually patents, sometimes copyrights. From the late 70s until the late 90s many venture backed start ups contributed key components to the information technology infrastructure we all now depend on. These businesses required a big R& D investment and often worked for several years developing their product before they hired their first sales or marketing people. Once they were ready to go to market they distributed their products through major equipment companies that sold a broad range of products to a large base of customers. Because it would have been relatively easy for a major manufacturer to mimic the innovation of a start up, solid intellectual property protection was the only way to defend the margins of these businesses and create an attractive return for the investors. As the technology infrastructure business matures, however, the nature of defensibility changes.  We do not expect IT enabled services businesses to have strong patent positions that would prevent anyone from entering a market. Instead, we look for defensibility in data.  We would argue that the network effect that makes it difficult to compete with Craigslist or eBay is based on a proprietary data asset. People go to these sites because they have lots of listings. This is a data asset. But it is not their only data asset. The systems for controlling reputation and spam at eBay and Craigslist are also built on a valuable data asset. As these systems accumulate data over time, they increase the value of the service and make it more difficult for newer services to deliver an equivalent experience.   In our portfolio, TACODA, has built a defensible position with a valuable data asset. TACODA works with the publishers in its network to make advertising more relevant to their audiences and more effective for their marketers. They do this by observing anonymous behaviors across the network and then serving relevant ads to users who visit other sites in the network. If TACODA observes a behavior that suggests the user is in the market to buy a car on one site, they can deliver auto advertising messages on another site in their network. TACODA can increase the value of publisher's audience by delivering an ad that is relevant to their audience, while the publisher can only show an ad that is relevant to the content on the site. This network wide view creates a valuable data asset, but TACODA is also able to see unexpected correlations between behaviors and ad performance (who knew that people with an interest in romantic movies were likely to click through on a car rental offer) and they can also see changes in these correlations over time. Finally, they have had to solve all of the practical problems associated with working with an enormous data set to deliver marketing messages in real time. There is, for example, a point in some campaigns where the cost of managing additional data is not justified by the incremental revenue that could be driven off of those data points. TACODA's hard won experience with this trade off will take time for a competitor to duplicate.  Information technology enabled services delivered over the internet evolve in a dialogue with their users. They are often created by their users or at least shaped in material ways by them. The data that is created as users interact with these services can be fed back into the services to improve them for the users. We are constantly surprised by the many creative ways this is being done. We do not pretend to know all of the ways that data will be used to improve a users experience and create barriers to entry, but we believe that it is the right place to look for differentiation and defensibility."
Scalability,BradUSV,2006-08-11 14:12:32,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"One of the common concerns about IT enabled services generally and web services specifically is that they do not have the potential to scale. When the focus of venture capital was on IT infrastructure, this criticism was often voiced as "" that's a feature not a company"". Today, a lot of the most interesting web services do seem to do one thing well - think Google, YouTube, or Skype. There have also been a number of recent s that could lead one to the conclusion that the major web players will buy up all the neat ""features"" and integrate them into a more ""complete"" offering. Many would offer Flickr and del.icio.us as examples.  The consolidation of the enterprise software business and the portalization of the web in the late 90s are historical examples that suggest that consumers want to simplify their commercial and media relationships and that only comprehensive services providers can compete our business. But users today seem to be more willing to visit many places on the web. It is not clear that a compelling service will only get traction if it is on the AOL or Yahoo home page. Search, social networks, and word of mouth have leveled that playing field.   We are not afraid of investing in a web service that does one thing well. If anything, we are more skeptical of a young company that claims to do many things well. When a young company presents a matrix that shows them doing everything that well established competitors do only better, we rarely ask them back.  On the other hand, we get very excited when we meet a company like del.icio.us or Indeed that does one thing well enough to have generated a large and growing base of loyal users. We believe that these and other businesses that serve users by doing one thing well can become large and important parts of the web ecosystem. Google achieved enormous scale by doing search well and despite the release of a slew of new products still gets the vast majority of their revenue from search.  But Google did not create that scale within the existing structure of that industry. They did it by introducing a disruptive new model that enabled them to aggregate audiences and then advertisers around two new value propositions (finding things and reaching people who are looking for things). Because we are betting on disruption, we do not expect a start up to make convincing argument for how it will achieve scale within the existing market structure. Rather, look for companies that can disrupt the existing market structure by doing one thing well and then we work with those companies to discover novel ways to scale in the restructured market.   Because I have used Google several times in this series as an example, I should address the risk that Google is the new market structure and that they will dominate web services the way Microsoft came to dominate PC software. It would be silly to pretend they are not a huge factor in web services but despite all of their talent and reach, it is not clear to us that their platform gives them the leverage to dominate social networking, user generated content and services, or vertical search to cite just a few current opportunities. We believe it is way too early to call this race. No one we know has a clear understanding of exactly how data will be used by web services like Google to create barriers to entry much less how new companies will try to break down those barriers. We also don't fully appreciate the impact of the net on the structure of the market for web services - will it favor aggregated or dissagregated services, or timing of market cycles - will they be faster or slower?  We do not pretend to understand all of the drivers that will shape the opportunity for start up web services. We do believe that successful services will do one thing very well. We do not believe that means these services are ""features not companies"". We believe that these companies can scale, and that how they will scale is not always predictable."
Business Development 2.0,fredwilson,2006-08-17 07:17:13,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"It used to be that web companies needed to hire one or more smart networkers and set them loose on all the other web companies in search of deals that bring traffic, users, additional functionality, revenue, and a host of other good things. Most of our companies have business development people and they are some of the most talented people in our companies.  But we have witnessed some interesting things happening in and around open apis, rss, search, crawling, embed code, widgets and mashups that suggests there's a new way to do business development. Here are but a few of the interesting things we have noticed:      * YouTube makes it flash video player available via embed code on MySpace and their traffic takes off.
    * TripAdvisor search engine optimizes its service and becomes one of the most popular travel services.
    * Technorati hits delicious' api for its tags and builds the web's most succesful tag search service.
    * Indeed crawls the Internet for jobs and builds a popular job service overnight.
    * Kayak crawls the Internet for flights, hotes, and cars, and builds a popular travel service overnight.
    * Qoop takes Flickr's API and builds a Flickr printing service without ever engaging with Flickr's team.
    * Netvibes takes a few RSS feeds and builds a start page that looks as complete as MyYahoo overnight.  You get the picture. These days it's often better to just take what's already freely available on the Internet to integrate with other web services. As Caternina explains in this post, the Flickr team didn't really have enough time to focus on the multitude of companies wanting to offer a printing service. Qoop just built one and when Flickr looked at it, it was an easy decision to offer it to their customers.  We have noticed another thing happening. When you do get a business development deal with a leading web service, the implementation is everything and it often isn't very good. Witness the job search space. Indeed has a deal with the NY Times. SimplyHired has a deal with MySpace. I've looked at the media metrix numbers and neither jobs service (NY Times and MySpace) is delivering any real usage (0.1% of myspace users visit careers.myspace.com which is SimplyHired's myspace service). Think of the time and energy that went into these deals. And to get 0.1% of the users to take up a service is so deflating. I think it might have been better to do some creative advertising deal that could have gotten done much quicker and might have delivered better results.  The bottom line is that web 2.0 offers a new way to get integration with leading web services and you don't have to waste your time and the time of other busy people trying to craft deals that will probably work out badly anyway. As Caterina says, ""Much, much better this way!"""
Welcome Andrew Parker,BradUSV,2006-08-17 10:27:51,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"A few weeks ago we mentioned that we were looking for the right person to replace Charlie, who had left us to take a product management position at Oddcast. Prior to this post, we had informally reached out to a few friends to let them know that we were looking for a talented person to fill Charlie’s shoes. We saw a number of strong candidates, but had this nagging feeling that we were missing something.   After one set of interviews Fred and I were re-hashing the candidates and the process and one of us – I don’t remember who – said lets run a post. The idea immediately struck both of us as crazy, or brilliant or possibly both. On the one hand, we instinctively believed that there were people out there following our firm through our blog who would be a great addition to the team, on the other hand, we had never seen a post dedicated to an analyst search, and had visions of being overwhelmed with resumes we didn’t want.   Fred, however, quickly came up with a refinement of the idea – asking people to reply by commenting on the post and pointing us to their web presence, a blog, a site, or a profile page - that made the idea work. You can see the results by looking through the comments on our post. We did not get over run and the quality of the folks who commented blew us away.   We knew that we wanted a young person who was an active participant on the web – a net native. All of the respondents pointed us to their presence on the web. These web presences were much more revealing than a resume. So when candidates arrived in New York, we already felt like we knew them. In each case, we jumped right into a conversation about the net’s impact on our society and economy – something we were both passionate about.   In the end, the toughest problem we had was choosing from among a bunch of very qualified people. We hope to keep all of them in the Union Square Ventures orbit and are working to introduce them to our portfolio companies where it makes sense.   That said, we are very pleased to welcome Andrew Parker to the Union Square Ventures team. Andrew blogs here   and you can more about his thoughts, life and art by following the link embedded in his comment on our post. "
Other Things We Look For,fredwilson,2006-09-06 17:26:25,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Last month Brad wrote a series of posts on the things we look for in our investments. Those posts are archived here. As Brad said in his introduction to those posts:  A year ago when we first re-launched our web site as a blog, we did so because we felt that the environment was too volatile for a fixed investment thesis.

Brad's posts focus on the market and business dynamics we look for; things like technology leverage, dispruptive potential, scalability, differentiation. And these are critical issues for us, we won't make an investment if we can't get comfortable in these areas.  But there are other things we look for that are more related to the structural and people side of the investment. They are also critical to us and we feel it's important to discuss them as well.  So I plan on posting on things like our approach to deal size, board seats, lead investor status, management/founder background, valuation, stage of business development, exit strategies, co-investors, and geographic location.  I do not plan on doing a post every day like Brad did. It will be more like one per week for the next couple months. I hope you enjoy them."
"History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme",BradUSV,2006-09-18 16:04:51,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"When Mark Twain said that, he almost certainly was not thinking about the fate of network operators and mini-computer companies, but it seems more and more likely that 20 years from now Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Comcast, Cingular and T-Mobile will be where DEC, Prime, Data General, Stratus, and Tandem are today.  Sun was right, at least about one thing – the network is the computer. Now, more than ever people get IT services from the cloud, whether its Gmail or Salesforce, or a hosted IP PBX. That trend, if anything, seems to be accelerating. So, if the network is the computer, what forces will shape the architecture of that computer.   In the 1980s mini-computer companies competed with each other at an architectural level. Customers invested in a DEC architecture or a Data General architecture. Their applications ran on one or the other but not both. When the PC companies burst on the scene, the mini-computer companies reacted (in character) by building architecturally differentiated “PCs” – remember the DEC Rainbow.   The PC companies like Dell and Compaq did not try to differentiate their architecture. Instead, they worked to improve the price performance of their products while maintaining compatibility with the standard PC architecture. They also innovated at the business process level, experimenting with direct distribution, flexible supply chains and low cost, high volume manufacturing systems  As PCs became more powerful and low cost servers began to displace core minicomputer applications, the minicomputer manufacturers used their substantial R&D capabilities and their access to capital, not to compete under the new rules but to try and extend the life of the old rules. Instead of focusing on reducing costs, they regarded their current cost structures as a given and looked for ways to improve margins by selling complete “value added” solutions.  For those of us who have been around for a while, the rumblings of the telcos about moving up into the applications space, or the cable companies moving more aggressively into content, or the wireless operators focus on value added “on deck” services all start to look familiar. None of these players seem to embrace the decentralized innovation that created the PC and the Internet. None seem to be using their substantial R&D capabilities and access to capital to build the best price performance connectivity. None seem to be innovating at the process level. They all seem obsessed with innovating at the architectural level, creating supersets of the open standards that created the web, and reaching up into the applications layer to create high margin vertically integrated “value added” solutions.  There are some substantial differences between the situation today and the one the minicomputer vendors faced 20 years ago, most importantly regulation of the last mile and wireless spectrum, but there are enough similarities to appreciate the rhyme.   The question is - who will be the Dell of the network service providers? Will one of the existing players recognize that decentralized innovation on a modular, standard platform will inevitably win in the long run and take the steps to position themselves as the low cost, high quality provider of standardized network services, or will a new player capitalize on that opportunity? My bet is the latter. "
Early Stage Investing,fredwilson,2006-09-19 06:06:52,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I thought I'd lead off my series of posts on ""other things we look for"" with a discussion of our preference for early stage investing. Most of our investment approach is built on top of our foundation as early stage investors.  But what does early stage investing really mean? It means different things to different people. For us, early stage investing means putting capital to work in a company well before it is fully formed and therefore participating in the value creation that comes with developing a new business. We are thesis driven investors who have a very specific set of business characteristics we look for. Brad outlined them very well in his series of posts last month. So if a company fits into our ""sweet spot"" (meaning it aligns well with our investment thesis and has the business characteristics we look for), we are more than willing to take on the risk of market development, business development, management team development, and business model development.  I'll use a couple of examples to make this point. The first one is delicious. When we invested in delicious, it was already an existing web service that had a relatively small but passionate user base. And it had a very compelling person in Joshua Schachter behind it. But there was no company, no management team, no office, no employees, no business development relationships, and no business model. Because delicious fit perfectly into our view of where the web was going, we were comfortable making an investment at that stage. We helped Joshua put many of those missing pieces into place and were working with him on the business model when the sale opportunity came up. Had delicious remained independent, we would have continued to work with Joshua and the management team to create a business around delicious.   The second example is Oddcast. When we invested in Oddcast, it had already established itself as the leading provider of flash based avatar services to the marketing community and small and medium businesses. It was a well developed company in many respects. It had a management team, an office, a sales team, a technology team, revenues, and happy customers. But we (the management of Oddcast and Union Square Ventures) see the opportunity to deploy Oddcast's avatar technology much more broadly into social media and mobile media services. There is a large business opportunity in front of Oddcast that was not well formed at the time we started looking at the investment. Our capital and advice has already been integrated into the company and they are using it to hire new people, enter into new business relationships, develop new technology, create new business models, and we are confident that our capital invested in Oddcast can have the same kind of impact on its business that our capital had on a ""startup"" company like delicious.  So it's not a simple metric that we use to define early stage like revenues or number of employees. It's our ability to put capital to work in the formation of a new business opportunity that is sizable and fits directly into our view of the markets we operate in that we look for.   The valuation of the business and the amount of capital that the company has already raised are also factors in our definition of early stage. I intend to address both of these issues in separate posts so I won't go into detail on them now, but we want our capital and counsel to be significant to the company we invest in. Generally that is not an issue with a ""startup"" company like delicious, but often it is with a more developed company like Oddcast. And that is why we end up investing in a lot more startup situations than more developed companies.  Early stage investing encompasses seed, startup, angel, and first round investing. It's a broad term that can be confusing. Stay tuned to my next several posts where I will address things like round size, valuation, round size, and business progress. Our approach to each of these issues further defines exactly how we approach the early stage venture capital business."
Traction,fredwilson,2006-09-30 10:16:24,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"This is my second post on ""other things we look for"".  I hesitated to use the title Traction because its certainly one of the most overused words in the venture capital vernacular. But it is also the ""shorthand"" peope use to talk about how much uptake a given project has gotten in the marketplace.  So the purpose of this post is to talk about how much ""traction"" we want to see in a given project before we will be comfortable investing in it.  We have two rules:  

don't invest in consumer facing web services without any consumers using them
there is an exception to every rule

  First, I'll explain our first rule and also discuss how it applies to ""enterprise facing web services"". Then I'll talk about when and how we break that rule.  The wonderful thing about the lightweight web services that are becoming the predominant form of software development these days is that they don't take a lot of time and money to build. That's why we see a new one launched every day (sometimes it seems every hour).  But the corrolary to that fact is that the nuances involved in designing and building these services are ciritical. I love to point to Ari Paparo's post on why delicious got it right and his service Blink.com, which was built years before, got it wrong. It was just three small design decisions that made the difference according to Ari. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with Ari's analysis, it's pretty clear that little things make all the difference in this new software paradigm that we call lightweight web services and most everyone else calls ""web 2.0"".  So, we may love the idea but until we see the implementation in a live setting (closed beta isn't live enough for us) we do not feel like we can assess the social adoption issues that are so critical. We don't care if it's called beta or commercial code. As long as it has been in the market and we can use it, see how others are using it, look at internal weblogs, and external services like Comscore and Alexa, we can make a good assessment of the adoption curve.  We are happy to talk to entrepreneurs long before they launch. In fact we spend more time doing that than pretty much anything else these days. We want to be able to watch a team take an idea from concept to execution. We learn so much from being able to do that. But until its launched, with tens of thousands of users (ideally hundreds of thousands) using it, we are unlikely to invest.  Some venture firms look for revenues, even revenues above a certain amount, or in some cases, profits. Many want to understand the business model. We don't need any of that to pull the trigger. But we want to see the most imporant thing - uptake. We think that's the hardest nut to crack.  So what about enterprise facing web services? We think they are not that different than consumer facing web services these days. Most of the important services that have been brought into the enterprise in recent years (salesforce.com, AIM, etc) have been brought in by workers who adopted them as consumers would adopt them and then got the enterprise to buy in over time. So we might have different adoption metrics (hundreds of thousands of users might be too much to expect from an enterprise facing web service in the early days), but we generally look for the same kind of adoption before we'll pull the trigger and write a check.  So that's our general rule, show us the ""traction"" and we'll be able to make an investment decision. Until then, we are happy to talk, learn, watch, and if you'd like, provide advice and counsel.  So when do we break this rule? Generally only when we know an entrepreneur/team really well. In our current fund, we've done it twice. With Isaak Karaev and the rest of the Multex team in their new company, Instant Information. And Peter Semmelhack (aka the hacker) in Bug Labs. We still need to love the idea, but these are also bets on people. And we've learned that its best to bet on people you know really well.  I hope this helps. And I hope you won't wait to come see us or start a dialog with us in some other way (maybe a comment on this blog?) until you've got traction. But we think its best that everyone understand what it takes to get us to pull the trigger and say yes."
Lead Investor,fredwilson,2006-10-15 11:46:53,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"My good friend Charley says that I ""don't follow very well"". He means that I don't like to participate in the Series B and C rounds of deals that have been funded by other venture capital firms in the Series A rounds. He's right. I've never been very good at that style of investing and I don't plan on getting good at it either.  When Brad and I wrote down the list of things we wanted Union Square Ventures to focus on, lead investing was near the top of the list. And there are a bunch of reasons why.

Lead investing allows Union Square Ventures to establish the capital and governance structures for our portfolio companies. Once these are set, they are hard to change. And every firm has a preferred way to approach governance and capital structures. So the best way to get them the way you want them is to be there when they are set up. That means leading the first venture capital round.  
Lead investing allows Union Square Ventures and the entrepreneur to establish a positive VC/entrepreneur relationship. That relationship is critical to the long term success of the company and getting it right early on is easier than trying to fix it later on. Coming into a Series B or Series C round where there is a dysfunctional investor/founder relationship is a recipe for disaster.  
Lead investing allows Union Square Ventures to establish ourselves as strategic business advisors to the companies we invest in. We often help the entrepreneur determine the appropriate business model and strategy. We can often recommend new avenues for growth and profit.  
Lead investing allows Union Square Ventures to get to our target ownership or at least establish a path to get to it in future rounds. When you invest in the later rounds, there are already a number of investors who have the right to maintain their ownership levels so it is often hard to obtain a significant ownership percentage in those rounds.  
Lead investing gives Union Square Ventures the opportunity to work with the entrepreneur to determine the investor group in future rounds. Many venture investors can and do help the companies they invest in, but many do not, and some are actually a negative experience for the company. We have a good network of quality investors who we like to invest with and we can help the entrepreneur tap into that network, which results in the ability to build a quality syndicate over time.  
Lead investing allows Union Square Ventures to build ""franchise value"" in the successful investments we have made. We don't and wouldn't claim to have done the really hard company building work that entrepreneurs do. But as the lead investor, it will often be true that we were the earliest and most active venture capital firm in the deal. So when a company has a susccessful exit, like delicious did last year, the venture firm most closely associated with the company gains some ""franchise value"" as well.

There are plenty of other reasons why lead investing is important to us, but these are certainly some of the most important reasons.  So the investments we are most interested in are the ones where we can lead the first round of ""professional capital"" that is invested into the company. We are happy to follow angels and friends and family rounds. In fact, we have participated in a number of those as well. But if you are coming to us with the Series B or Series C round in a company that has been funded by other venture capitalists before us, it's unlikely (but not out of the question) that we'll be interested."
Deal Size,fredwilson,2006-10-24 17:21:20,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Brad and I have been doing early stage investing since the late 80s (me) and early 90s (Brad). For most of our career, a typical early stage venture round was $5mm to $6mm and you'd put two firms together and each would invest $2.5mm to $3mm.  So when we sat down to build the business plan for Union Square Ventures, we started with that model. But recognizing that we were focusing on a sector (web services) which could be a lot more capital efficient, we put another kind of investment in the model, the $1mm investment. We assumed that about 25% of our investments would start with much smaller bite sizes.  We are about half way through building our portfolio and here is the distribution of initial investment sizes (I am including one investment we are about to close in here as well):  Below $500k - 2 $500k to $1mm - 2 $1mm to $2mm - 2 $2mm to $3mm - 2 Above $3mm - 1  So what this says is we are starting our investment positions in our portfolio companies with $1mm and under investments almost half of the time. And the $2.5mm to $3mm starting investment (traditionally the typical Series A round bite size) is only about one third of what we are doing these days.  That is a departure. Maybe a significant departure. But we are comfortable with it because we are seeing that we are able to obtain our target ownership levels of 15% to 20% even with these smaller investments (although sometimes it takes us a couple rounds to get there).  It also allows us to take more risk, whether it be management team risk, service adoption risk, market size risk, business model risk, or some other risk or combination of the above.  When the amount of capital we have at risk is low, we can try some things that we would not be comfortable trying with $2.5mm to $3mm invested. So it allows us to get involved in things that are farther out on the risk curve with potentially more upside if things work out.  The most important factor, however, is the capital efficiency we are seeing in our portfolio companies. They simply don't need as much money as the companies we backed 5 years ago, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago. They may need as much capital when they become big businesses and need to invest to grow. But the clearly do not need as much capital to get from idea to commercial launch and to revenues.  We could go into all the reasons why that is the case, but we have addressed them in the past on this blog and elsewhere and we want to keep these posts relatively short and sweet.  We are generally not putting up all the capital in the rounds we are leading. We often will take between 50% and 60% of the round. We have done closer to 80% of the round in a couple of situations. We like to find another venture capital firm to invest alongside of us in these rounds, but given the deal sizes, that sometimes will not work and we have invested alongside angels in three of our initial investments. We have also partnered with strategic investors three times.  So you can multiply the numbers in the list at the ning of this post by 1.5 to 2x to see the typical round sizes we are leading. That said, we have not participated in an initial round larger than $5mm yet in this fund. That is not to say we wouldn't do it, but we haven't yet and it would take something particularly interesting to get us to do it.  Does this make Union Square Ventures a ""seed fund"". We don't think so. We have led investments in companies with significant revenues on multiple occasions. And we think we will be able to (over time) get $5mm to $8mm invested in our portfolio companies and we are already there with one of them . We can invest up to $20mm in any single company in the portfolio. So we are not a ""seed fund"".  We think this approach makes us an early stage fund that believes in raising only enough money to achieve a set of near term milestones which should significantly impact valuation. That's really classic early stage investing. Only we think we may now be able to start with a lot less at risk in the markets we are focusing on. And that's a good thing."
Customer Service is the New Marketing,BradUSV,2006-11-07 10:00:51,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"I had a cup of coffee yesterday with Craig Newmark. Toward the end of the conversation, I told him that one of the most important things I learned by studying Craigslist was the importance of customer service.  Craig is, famously, a customer service rep at Craigslist. He describes himself as working for their head of customer service. He also describes himself as socially inept, which he proves, in part, by not being able to keep his laptop closed during our conversation. Instead, every once in a while he lifts the lid, hits a few keys, closes the lid, looks up, smiles with a sense of accomplishment and says, there goes another live animal scam.  When I told him that, from him, I had learned that in the world of lightweight web services, customer services is the new marketing. He said, you know, you should blog that, so dutifully – here is the post.  Customer service is the new marketing because you can realize the radical efficiencies of the web only by enlisting the users of the service as co-contributors. The best web services provide bandwidth, cpu, storage and a governance system and then their users create the service. This is certainly true of Craigslist but it is also true of more commercial implementations like YouTube, Flickr, and del.icio.us. So if your users are your co-contributors, your co-creators really, what does it mean to sell them?
 
If you need to convince your contributors of the value of your service you have probably already lost. All of the web services I mentioned are free, so selling them doesn’t make literal sense anyway. What you can do is serve them, and serving them is the best marketing you can do. Why, because only by serving them, can you learn what it is that would make the service more useful to them.  In the world of products, you need to do the research, find a need, build a bunch widgets and then push them. The cycles are long and it is very difficult to change the product to meet a new need that you discovered once the product is in the market. In the world of web services this is not the case. We were not, alas, insiders at You Tube, so I have no idea how You Tube came up with the idea of creating an embeddable player that you could put on your MySpace page, but I would not be at all surprised to learn that someone had asked them for it.  With del.icio.us, we learned that if you put a simple rudimentary service out there, not only would your users - your co-creators – tell you what you needed to improve the service; if you let them, they would do the work themselves. I am still amazed at the number of really cool widgets, and add-ons that were created by the del.icio.us community.  If customer service is the new marketing, it has some important implications in how you build a web services business. First, it means that you need to get the service out there quickly. Designing a comprehensive feature set and spinning it a couple of times in a small closed beta is not going to work. If the service provides value in its initial rudimentary form, your users will take it and run with it. If you launch it fully formed , at best, you have robbed them of the pleasure of co-creating the service, at worst you have created something that nobody wants.  It also means that spending your way into the market won’t work. A web service needs to be pulled into a market and promoted by its users – its co-creators. Pushing it into the market may lead to some initial trials but won’t lead to viral growth.   Web services should also be open with their data. Being closed is, first of all, an affront to your users who see themselves as the creators of the service. They rightly think of the data as theirs. They think of the service as the custodian of that data. They trust the service to care for it, but they also expect it to be available to them and to other services that will create more value for them.  Making the data available is also the best way to learn from the users. With it, they will add features, create more uses, embed it in their MySpace page and in general help you define your service. Without access, they can do little but send you an email asking for a change.  So if customer service is the new marketing, and many if not most web services are ad-supported, there is an obvious problem…  If you offer your web service for free to gain rapid adoption and to listen and learn from your users with the hope of supporting the service by selling advertising to marketers, what happens if those marketers wake up and decide that customer service is the new marketing. If marketers decide to cut their marketing budgets and invest instead in customer service, who is going to spend the marketing dollars that will support all these useful services?  Fortunately, as important as web services are, they still represent a relatively small part of the economy. There are still many marketers out there whose users either are not or can not co-create their products. It is interesting to think about what happens as web services become a relatively more important part of the economy, but that is the subject of another post.

Geography,fredwilson,2006-11-28 06:11:35,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Each month we see something like thirty to fifty new investment opportunities that generally fit our investment strategy. They come from all over the place. Just in the past month, we've seen opportunities in Israel, Australia, China, London, San Diego, Boulder, Atlanta, Boston and the Bay Area. It seems like our deal flow gets more geographically diverse every month. Web delivered technology startups are sprouting up all over the world.  But if you look at the eight investments we've made so far in our current fund, seven have been in the New York area and one has been in Chicago. We have not yet made an investment in the Bay Area even though we have seen many high quality deals from there over the past couple years.  And therein lies the quandry we face. We want to know entrepreneurs from all over the world. We want to know about all the interesting startups, no matter where they are located. We want to stay on top of new developments. And the Internet allows us to do that pretty easily. This is a map of the geographic location of the visitors to my blog in the past week. It shows the geographic diversity of our reach.   So we have developed a brand and a presence that has national and even international reach. That allows us to stay on top of the most interesting developments and entrepreneurs, no matter where they are coming from.  So why have we concentrated our investments in New York City? Well it has to do with our focus on early stage investing, our desire to be a lead investor, and our desire to be actively engaged with the entrepreneurs we fund.  If you look at the things we do for our portfolio companies, they generally fall into the following areas; help in recruiting management teams, help in financial planing and fundraising, help in business development and strategic partnerships, and mentoring, coaching, and advising the founders and their team.  The first item, helping to recruit teams, is one where geography matters a lot. We know a ton of people in NYC who either work in the web industry or in related industries like media, marketing, entertainment, financial services, and telecom. We have a great network here in NYC to help companies build management teams. We don't have that kind of network in Atlanta, Seattle, or London. So we can't be nearly as helpful in recruiting in those geographies.  The last item, mentoring, coaching, and advising, is better done face to face. Sure you can advise over the phone, IM, or email. But it pales in comparison to the value of a face to face breakfast once or twice a month. A few of our companies, like Delicious and Bug Labs, are even located in our building so we are/were able to work with them on a daily basis.  The middle two items, financial planning/fundraising and strategy/business development, don't require as much face to face time, but even so being local is a big help. Passing spreadsheets over email is one thing. Sitting down face to face with the CEO and the CFO is another. We prefer the latter approach and have found that it just works better.  If you look at my personal track record, the facts are hard to ignore. Prior to raising Union Square Ventures, we prepared a detailed due diligence book for potential investors. We looked at our personal track records, all the investments we had sourced and managed prior to starting Union Square Ventures, and looked at it a bunch of different ways, including by geography.  Prior to starting Union Square Ventures, I had ""led"" twenty four investments, representing $230mm of invested capital and, at the time, just over $1bn of value. Those numbers have gone up a bit since then but I am not going to update the analysis just for this post. The gross return multiple (before fees and carry) was 4.6x cost.  There were thirteen investments (just over half of the total) in the NY metro area which represented $144mm of investment at cost and $832mm of value. The gross return multiple was 5.8x cost.  All of the other investments combined represented $86mm at cost and $219mm of value and a gross return multiple of 2.5x.  It's hard to argue with those numbers. I am simply better at making local investments. 5.8 times your money is a lot better than 2.5x.  I explain that difference largely on the basis of the leverage we can apply to companies when we are local and can engage with the entrepreneur, as I explained above. But I also believe that we have the benefit of seeing a much higher percentage of the best deals in the NYC area than we do elsewhere.   I am not entirely sure that is always going to be the case. As we move more and more toward thesis driven investing, entrepreneurs are getting to know us from afar and when the things they are working on fit nicely into our investment themes, they are showing us their deals.  And we have been very intrigued recently by a number of things we've seen that are not located in NYC. We tried to convince one small team to relocate to NYC and build their business here. We got close, but in the end they decided to sell the company instead.  We are spending some time on an opportunity in London, the second we've seen there in the past year that we really like. We are spending some time on an opportunity in Israel that wants to locate its headquarters in NYC. We continue to look at deals in Boston, Boulder, and the Bay Area.  My guess is that when we are all said and done with our current fund, with something like 18-20 companies in our portfolio, we will have three to six companies that are located outside the NYC area and at least one that is located outside the United States.  There is simply too much innovation going on elsewhere to focus exclusively on NYC. But even so, the majority of our investments will be here in the NYC area, the place we know best and where we can do our best work for our portfolio companies.   When we do make investments outside of our local geography, we will look for certain things to make us more comfortable. We will want to work with an entrepreneur we know well and a co-investor who is local and has a similar style and worldview. We are likely to be attracted to slightly more mature companies, where the the key members of the team are in place, and the strategy settled. And we'll look for something that is dead center in our sweet spot.  So that's how we think about geography in our investment process. I know that entrepreneurs have not had a great sense of how we think about geography. I hope this post helps clarify it."
Founders and Management,fredwilson,2007-01-10 12:46:42,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"It's been a while since our last post on this blog. Year end activities got in the way. We were in the midst of a string of posts on what we look for in our investments when we went radio silent. We've addressed issues like the stage we like to invest (early), the amount of traction the company has made, our desired role as lead investor, deal size, and our approach to geography.  We figured we'd come back strong by addressing the most important piece of venture capital investing equation - the people we are considering backing.  Background  There are two kinds of people that we have to consider in this process. There is the person or group of people who came up with the idea and started the company, the founders. And there are the people who are currently operating the business, the managers. They are often the same, but not always. And it's also true that the founders' role will change over time as the company grows, and the managers' role will become more important.  But since we are generally investing within a year of the company's formation, when there are less than ten employees, it is almost always the case that the founder is the person running the business. But it is also almost always the case that the founder has surrounded themselves with some other people whose talents and temperament will have a meaningful impact on the business. We need to consider how all of these people will work together to drive the business forward. We cannot and do not look at just one person when we make an investment, unless there is just one person involved when we write the check. That has already happened twice so far in the short history of Union Square Ventures. I'll come back to the situations in which we'll consider doing that later on in the post.  No business is so good that the wrong people can't mess it up. And no business is so bad that the right people can't fix it. If you think about what a business is, it's a collection of people who have been organized in attempt to profit from offering a product or service to the marketplace. So if you don't get the people part of the equation right, everything else is really immaterial.  And the people issues always start at the top of the company. Great people attract and retain great people and build a culture where the best people like to work. They value people, compensate them well, motivate them well, and manage them well. On the other hand, there are plenty of people who don't have what it takes to lead an organization. For some people, that is because they don't enjoy managing people. For others, that is because they don't have the empathy or self awareness that is required to manage others. There are many reasons why some people don't make good managers and leaders.  We believe that management and leadership can be learned and we strive to keep the founders of the companies we back in leadership roles for as long as is possible, often that will be until the company is sold. But we also recognize that some people will not make it as leaders and we must be careful to avoid the damage that can result to a fragile early stage company that results from having the wrong leadership followed by a leadership change.  We also recognize that many leadership changes work out badly. There are so many examples of companies where the founder either stepped aside or was pushed aside in favor of ""operating management"" and then the hired management was even worse. We work very hard to avoid that circumstance.  Our Criteria  So with that backdrop, this is what we look for in founders and managers.  First and foremost, we look for people who we will enjoy working with. We've been investing in early stage technology businesses for over 20 years and we've backed people we like and we've backed people we ended up having great difficulty with. We've made the decision that no matter how attractive an investment opportunity may be, we will not get involved if we do not think there is a high likelihood of a very positive working experience. That is partially a recognition that the entrepreneur/VC relationship is critical to the success of the company. But it also a recognition that if we enjoy working with a person or a group of people, it is more likely that others will as well.  We also seek to back entrepreneurs and managers that we've worked with successfully before. We realize that this sets up a ""club relationship"" where it's hard to break in. And we also realize that some of the best entrepreneurs will be first time entrepreneurs. So we have a process to make sure we back first time entrepreneurs, but the hurdles are simply higher.  When an entrepreneur or even better a founding team that we've backed before successfully comes to see us with a new opportunity, we are usually very inclined to support it with our time, energy, and capital. Of course, we have to feel that the business concept has merit and it needs to fit into our investment strategy. And in some cases that doesn't happen and we don't invest. But when a team we've backed before with success comes to us with a concept that is in our sweet spot, there is a very high likelihood that we will invest. We like to think of these entrepreneurs as ""franchise"" entrepreneurs.  We are also fans of teams that come back to market with a new opportunity where we were not the investor the previous time. We've watched many great entrepreneurs work from afar (or even close up when our companies compete with or work with them). And when they decide to start something new, we are always eager to talk to them. It's a bit harder for us to be confident that the relationship will work well, but in these situations we do a lot of calling around to learn what it is like to work with these entrepreneurs. We take the time to build a relationship before we invest. We like to think of these entrepreneurs as ""serial"" entrepreneurs.  But as I mentioned previously, we need to be open to first time entrepreneurs who have no track record with us or others. With this group, we look for traction on the business plan, a service in the market that is being used and getting favorable reaction from the market. We want to spend a lot of time ""hanging around the rim"" on these deals so we can be certain that our style and the entrepreneur's style will work well together. We talk a lot about how the entrepreneur plans to develop as a leader or if they don't, how they plan to develop others to lead the business.  The first time entrepreneur is the riskiest of the three kinds of teams we will back, so when we do it, we want there to be much less risk in other parts of the business. If the service is in the market, gaining traction, with revenues flowing, and the business developing nicely, then there is less likelihood of the kind of conflict over strategy and business direction that creates tension in the entrepreneur/VC relationship.  But even with all of that, we still need to see a personality type or a set of personalities that can create a culture that will attract and retain the best people. We need to see someone or a group of people who understand that a company is a collection of people, nothing more and nothing less. Because we never back just one person, we are backing a group of people who will grow in size and complexity over time and we need to be sure that the people leading it are capable of the challenges that such growth entails.  I promised that I'd address the two times we backed just one person. The first time was Joshua Schachter and Delicious. At the time we backed Joshua, Delicious was already a very successful service in the marketplace, a leader in the category, and a leader in the emerging market we now call web 2.0. Nevertheless, we spent a great deal of time hanging around the rim with Joshua before he and Union Square Ventures decided to become financial partners. We got comfortable that Joshua understood the value of people and that he could attract the right talent to the business. We also introduced Joshua to Albert Wenger who over time became Joshua's partner in managing the business. Had Delicious remained independent, we were confident that Joshua and Albert would have built a great team and a great company.  The second time is Peter Semmelhack and Bug Labs. Peter is a serial entrepreneur we had watched from afar with great respect. Further, we knew him socially through a number of connections. When Peter came to us with the idea for Bug Labs, it did not take us long to make the decision to back him. Peter has already assembled a wonderful team, a number of whom had worked in his prior companies.  The serial team is something we value greatly. Isaak Karaev has brought many of his best team members from Multex to his new company Instant Information. Dave Morgan brought many of his best team members from Real Media to TACODA. The founding team at FeedBurner has worked together for more than ten years in a number of companies and startups. When you see that at work, you know you are investing in a team of people that know how to work together, where the culture is existent from day one, and where the probability of success is very high.  Statistics  I'll end this long post (sorry but this is complicated stuff and I've barely scratched the surface), with some stats. We have invested in eight companies so far at Union Square Ventures and have term sheets out for three more, none of which are guaranteed to close. The eleven companies break down as follows:  Franchise Entrepreneurs - Two Serial Entrepreneurs - Five First Time Entrepreneurs - Four  So even with our desire to back proven teams, we have found a number of exciting first time entrepreneurs to back as well. I expect that when this portfolio is all said and done and we have eighteen to twenty companies in it, about forty percent will be first time entrepreneurs, forty percent will be serial entrepreneurs, and twenty percent will be franchise entrepreneurs. That feels like a good mix."
Why We Don't Invest In Competitive Businesses,fredwilson,2007-01-15 12:02:06,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I was trading emails with one of our portfolio company CEOs last week. The subject was a company that was looking for venture capital that offered a service that was similar to one of the services our portfolio company offered. The CEO was encouraging me to take a close look. He said, ""someone is going to invest, it might as well be someone close to our company"".  I told him that I completely disagreed with that philosophy. I said ""When a VC invests in competitive companies it's like an open marriage. It sounds all well and good, but it's going to create problems down the road.""  He laughed and suggested I blog that. And so I have.   I have never understood ""open marriages"". The idea is you are married but free to have relationships with others too. Maybe there are men and women who can deal with the complexities, conflicts, and uncertainties that such an arrangement would create, but I am certainly not one of them. I like to know where my loyalties lie and I like to know where the loyalties of others who are close to me lie as well.  And that's why we don't invest in competitive businesses. Let's say we had two portfolio companies that both offered a video uploading/sharing service. And let's say we had a relationship with a leading media company that was looking for a partnership in that area. Which of our two companies services would we suggest they adopt? Well we could introduce both companies and let the two slog it out for the business. But it would be hard for us to be an advocate for either one of them and as a result our relationship with the media company partner would be of less value to everyone.  What if one of our companies was approached by a potential buyer? Would we feel obliged to get both of our companies in the process? What if the founders of the company that was approached weren't looking to sell, but the other company's founders were?  Hopefully you see my point. Just like there are some people who can manage being in an ""open marriage"" there are some investors who can manage these conflicts and complexities. But we can't.  We want to be the best partners we can be to our portfolio companies. That means clearly establishing where our loyalties lie and being consistent and vocal advocates for our companies. That works best for us and as a result we don't invest in competing businesses.  Now occasionally we will have two companies, that by virtue of acquisitions or changes in strategy, will find themselves in competition with each other. We don't control our companies, so we cannot promise that won't happen. But it makes us uncomfortable when it does happen and we work to avoid these situations if at all possible."
What's next?,BradUSV,2007-01-24 18:40:22,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"The sense of progress in the computer industry is so strong that it feels almost inevitable. That momentum may be most obvious in the increasing capabilities of the underlying technology – faster chips, cheaper storage, and more bandwidth, but there is another dimension of that progress that has become increasingly clear over the last thirty years. The basis of competition in the industry keeps changing, and it appears to change in ways that make the key differentiators between providers ever more relevant to users.  In the early days, the central value proposition in the computer business was hardware. Later, it shifted to systems software, then applications software, and then networks. As more software functionality was delivered to a browser over the internet, the basis of competition shifted from features to service level metrics like reliability, accessibility and security. I believe that today, at least in the area of consumer web services, we have already moved on to a new focus of competitive differentiation based on data.   The web services that seem to explode onto the scene like Facebook and YouTube did not get there by providing exceptional reliability, accessibility or security. In fact many have suffered outages that would have killed other service providers. These services succeeded because they effectively gather and use data. They are differentiated not by the quality of their service but by its nature. Competitors can offer much better service levels but without access to the same data, they can not offer the same utility.  No one really cares about the hardware, software, or network that Craigslist uses to deliver its posts. Craigslist’s users expect a basic level of service, but don’t judge the service on its uptime or speed. Just as they assume that the PC they buy today will have enough storage, they expect Craigslist to be available and reasonably snappy. The basis of competition has shifted from how the service is delivered to what service is delivered. What services are delivered depends entirely on the data.  This progression from hardware to systems software to applications software, to network, to service, and now to data has such a compelling momentum that leads inexorably to the question – What’s next?  One way to look at that question is to argue that we have arrived at the end of history. The progression to date has been up the stack in a classic architecture diagram, data is on top of that stack, and nothing sits on top of the data. I disagree.  The genius of Craigslist is in its governance system. It is its lightweight governance system that allows 21 people to administer 300 sites in 35 countries. I believe that the basis of competition in web services will shift from the data to the system that manages the acquisition, and use of that data. The governance system that yields the most utility for the largest number of users with the least overhead will ultimately manage the largest communities with the most valuable data.   Is there a basis for competition beyond the governance systems underlying these services? If pressed, I would guess it will be values. It might be possible for two equally effective governance systems to compete by internalizing different values. One could perhaps embrace openness and diversity at the cost of some efficiency and the other could be optimized for efficiency for a more homogeneous set of users and interests. After that maybe they will compete on aesthetics or maybe there is no more “stuff on top” as Nicolas Carr once said to me. Maybe then we really are talking about the end of IT history. What do you think?"
SIAA Preview Keynote,fredwilson,2007-01-30 08:32:47,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I gave a keynote at the Information Industry Summit yesterday during the ""preview session"" which features emerging information businesses.  We've been investing in information businesses for years at the various firms I've worked for and I've watched the business change a lot in recent years. So when I thought about what to talk about, I decided that it was time to talk about reality. That information is getting less expensive everyday and the value in information businesses is moving from the content itself to the way the content is delivered.  The title of the talk is ""Does Information Want To Be Free"" and it's available as a PDF here.  And thanks to Scribe Media, here is a video of my presentation.

AdaptiveBlue,BradUSV,2007-02-21 17:54:26,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"The genius of the web is that it is flat – anything can be a link and anything can be linked to. But this is also one of its greatest limitations. When you come across the word Taurus on the web, you probably know immediately if it the word refers to a car, a bull or an astrological sign. Your computer does not. You know because you are adept at using clues from the surrounding text or because of the context of your current activity. Because computers can not figure out this context by themselves we must do that work for them. We learn to add “car” as an additional search term if that is what we are looking for. We accept the fact that after reading a review of a Taurus car we will still need to type Taurus into the search box on AutoTrader because we have no other way to tell AutoTrader about the review we just read or what we were doing before we came to their site. The list of frustrations goes on. If we discover an event online and then want to book tickets, or just get it into our calendar, we start from scratch by telling whatever service or application we are using what we want to do.  We are, of course, huge fans of the web. It is an amazing resource, but the more we use the Web, the more we become aware of what it can not do. Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the Web recognized the limitations of the web very early on. He also realized that if we could add a layer of semantic information to the web it would become possible for computers do much more for us.   Tim’s proposed solution to this problem is the Semantic Web - a way of adding semantic information to hypertext links to make those links more useful to both computers and people. The most well developed effort to bring semantics to the web is Microformats. There are now Microformats defined for concrete things like calendar entries and contact information and more abstract things like social relationships. This is important work that holds great promise, but it is also excruciatingly slow work. First, a format for defining the semantics of a class of things, cars, movies, lists, currency, etc must be defined and agreed upon, then the producers of web content must incorporate the format into the content they publish. Only then can applications and services take advantage of this semantic information. There are some great early examples of microformats in action, but they still today represent a tiny minority of the content on the web.   An alternative approach would be to use artificial intelligence to derive semantic information from the ordinary text that makes up the majority of the webs content today. This would save us the trouble of defining a format for every class of object on the web and would make it possible to extract semantic information from the language surrounding any object after the fact. This approach has the advantage that it requires no effort to define the formats and no work on the part of the content creators to incorporate those formats in the content they publish on the web. Unfortunately, it is a very hard technical problem, one that requires a lot of processor resources and even then works only sporadically in very specific situations. It is also hard to imagine that consumers would have the patience to wait for a complete semantic analysis of every page they visited before moving on to the next page.  It is easier to add semantics (and the services that depend on those semantics) to links in the context of a specific site. Amazon has taken advantage of their knowledge of the objects on their web pages to create a lot of useful features. When you are looking at a movie on Amazon, they can show you every movie by that director. They can show you movies that are in the same genre. They can even show you movies that have nothing in common with the movie you are looking at except that people who liked that movie also liked these other movies, a surprisingly useful trick called collaborative filtering. Amazon can do a bunch of other things that make your life easier on the web because they know you. They can push you through check-out quickly and automatically ship your goods via your preferred carrier. They can reference your buying history to remind you of birthdays or to personalize product searches. Amazon realized several years ago that their ability to deliver useful services to consumers was more important than their identity as a book seller and they broadened their offerings to enable them to capture more of the consumer's attention, further strengthening their services, and ultimately enabling them to grow their share of the consumer’s wallet.  As great as this experience is for loyal Amazon customers, some consumers are concerned that they creating a dependency that may not be in their best interest. They worry that Amazon can never encompass all of the offers that they would find interesting, and they are nagged by the suspicion that the everyday items they buy at Amazon could be found more cheaply elsewhere. At the same time, they wonder why they can’t have the richness and utility of their Amazon experience everywhere they go on the web.   This is the promise of the Semantic Web. If all of the objects on the web included rich semantic details about those objects, everything Amazon does today (and more) would be natively available anywhere on the World Wide Web. Alternatively, if Artificial Intelligence advanced to the point that rich semantic data could be derived in real time from every web page using the processing power of a personal computer, all of these services would be accessible to anyone, anywhere on the web.   A year ago, Alex Iskold decided that neither approach was likely to deliver on this promise quickly. So he founded AdaptiveBlue to see if he could offer a useful set of services to consumers in the meantime. He took a pragmatic approach combining a lightweight semantic analysis and a narrow focus on a limited set of popular objects like books, movies, wine, and electronics, to see if he could 1) identify many of the objects we come across on the web and 2) anticipate and present a set of possible actions one might want to take having found that object. If you are reading a review of a particular wine, would it be helpful, for instance, to have other similar wines or other wines by the same winemaker available a single click away?   When we met Alex last October, we were surprised by how often AdaptiveBlue’s analysis was able to tease out semantic information about objects on the web and how useful it was to have information and services related to that object immediately at hand. We believe that AdaptiveBlue’s services will simplify browsing, create meaningful recommendations, filter information, and enhance productivity.  AdaptiveBlue works across a large portion of the web today.  There is no requirement for individual site owners to add their own metadata because AdaptiveBlue leverages their own top-down approach to building a semantic web.  However, we are particularly excited about the prospect of the AdaptiveBlue developing tools that allow users to build the semantic web from the bottom-up to fill in the gaps and correct the top-down approach when necessary.     We are also pleased to be in business with Alex Iskold. We closed on a Series A investment in AdaptiveBlue late last week. Alex is an experienced entrepreneur and a contributor to Read/Write Web.  We have been consistently impressed by Alex’s opinions regarding the prospect of a semantic web and the market for lightweight web services.  We are excited to be a part of the dialogue around Alex, AdaptiveBlue, and the Semantic Web.    "
Outside.in,fredwilson,2007-02-23 11:07:45,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"One form of media that hasn't yet been well executed on the Internet is local media. Yes, local search is available, and Google's offering in this area has become very good recently. Local classifieds are also all over the Internet, particularly at Craigslist. And listings are also emerging as a robust category with the advent of services like Yelp.  But where do you turn to when you want to know what's going on in your city, town, or neighborhood? Nothing has really filled the role of the town paper yet.  And we all know the commercial power of local media. Most commerce is done locally. Look at the advertisers who populate the local paper, the yellow pages, and the local radio stations. They need a place to  go online and when they find it, the dollars that will flow are large, very large. Clearly search will get a big piece of that pie (search always does), but the killer local service is one that can serve the residents and the merchants of a city, town, and neighborhood the way the local paper has in the past.  Enter placeblogging. Placebloggers are local citizens who know what is going on in their town and take the time to talk about it on the web.  They blog about local real estate concerns, town politics, the high school baseball game, the opening of a new starbucks, and the closing of everyone's favorite pizza parlor.  Like most blogging, the spectrum runs the gamut from the truly  professional blogs like Gothamist in New York to the stay at home ""blogger mom"" like my wife, The Gotham Gal. Some will placeblog for a living, but the vast majority of placeblogging is a labor of love.   Imagine if you could aggregate up all the posts that every placeblogger writes and sort them by city, town, village, zip code, street, or address. And imagine if each of those ""sorts"" became a media property of their very own – the Greenwich Village blog, or the Castro blog.  That is exactly what outside.in is doing. They've built a platform that placebloggers can submit their content to. Their platform ""tags"" that content with a geocode -- an address, zip code, or city -- and that renders a new page for every location that has tagged content. If you visit outside.in/10010, you'll find out what's going on in the neigborhood around Union Square Ventures. If you visit  outside.in/back_bay, you'll see what's going on in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood.  But it doesn't stop there. Every geolocation is a feed in outside.in. So you can subscribe to the Santa Monica feed if you want to
keep track of what's going on in Santa Monica. Better yet, if you are a placeblogger in Beverly Hills, you can use the Beverly Hills feed to supplement your posts and offer your readers a more complete view of what is going on in your neighborhood.  You can also use a map to navigate outside.in. You might not know the  zip code you want to keep track of but outside.in lets you use a Google map to drill down to exactly where you want to read about and the page renders the relevant posts.  Outside.in is also a community with people and places in it. You can look at a person's favorite posts, favorite places, and favorite neighborhoods. These community features are brand new and their effect on the service has yet to be seen.  The reason I am telling you all of this is that Union Square Ventures recently invested in an angel round of financing for Outside.in.  We were joined by a collection of really smart thinkers about the web like John Seely Brown, Marc Andressen, Esther Dyson, and John Borthwick. Two early stage venture firms also joined the financing, Village Ventures and Milestone Ventures.  This is the typical first round of outside capital that will allow outside.in to grow from three founders, John Geraci, Cory Forsyth, and Steven Johnson, to a team of closer to ten people. That should be enough to build the service out into something really special.  We have learned that the best web services are two way systems. They take content in, add something to it, and then send it back out.  YouTube works this way. So do delicious and Flickr. To date, we haven't seen such a service for placebloggers. Outside.in will hopefully fill that void and we are excited to be involved.

TargetSpot,fredwilson,2007-04-23 21:14:40,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I’ve spent a lot of time in the past eight years working with the radio broadcast industry on the conversion of their business from analog to digital. That work is largely related to my role as a director and financial investor in a company called iBiquity, which was formed by the broadcast radio industry over ten years ago to build a digital system for broadcast radio (now called HD Radio). I have met many of the executives from the leading radio station groups and have talked to them about the challenges and opportunities that arise from the conversion of their business from analog to digital. I have written about many of these challenges and opportunities on my personal weblog over the years.  Last year, I was attending a meeting at CBS Radio and saw their new tagline – CBS Radio – Broadcast, Streaming, On Demand – and I realized that the radio business was headed in the right direction. CBS Radio and the other large station groups now recognize that they are in the audio programming business not the broadcast business. And CBS Radio’s tagline explicitly makes the point that their audio programming is available over the air digitally (via HD Radio), over the internet via streaming, and on demand through digital downloads.   I consume radio content via all three digital distribution channels. I have several HD Radios and frequently listen to the new stations on the HD2 channel. I subscribe to my favorite radio shows like Morning Becomes Eclectic via podcasts in iTunes. But more and more, I listen to the radio over the internet, both on my computer and via my Sonos system.   Streaming radio is very popular already. A recent comScore study reported the cumulative monthly audience of the top four online radio networks at 6.2mm US listeners. If you include all internet radio, that number is certainly well over 10mm montly listeners and could be larger than the subscriber base to satellite radio (~13mm subscribers at year end 2006). And as more and more stations come online with streams and more digital devices support internet streams, streaming radio is going to get even more popular.  But streaming radio isn’t yet a profitable business for broadcasters for several reasons. First and foremost, the broadcasters haven’t had a good monetization system for streaming radio. Because internet radio isn’t an inherently local service (I listen to KCRW in Santa Monica over the internet in my home in NYC all the time), the local advertisers who populate the “over the air” service have a hard time with the internet stream. In addition, streaming is more expensive for a broadcaster than putting out a signal over the air. Each stream costs them incrementally, which is not true in the broadcast world. And the new royalty rates make music programming delivered over the internet potentially more expensive than music programming delivered over the air.  So broadcasters have a challenge. How do they embrace internet radio without piling up losses?   That challenge seems like an opportunity to us. And so Union Square Ventures has participated in the creation of a new company called TargetSpot that has been built specifically to solve this problem for broadcasters. TargetSpot is an advertising system built from day one for internet radio. The technology was developed by our portfolio company Oddcast and was designed by David Goodman and his team at CBS Radio. A number of others involved in the internet radio business also provided input into the design of the system. TargetSpot is a full-featured ad network that supports a wide range of hyper-targeting technologies that make it possible for local and national advertisers to comfortably place, target, and buy internet radio. TargetSpot also features a self serve bidded advertising  market like what is provided by Google and others in the search advertising world to make it easy for the small business to purchase audio advertising. With TargetSpot, a local plumber will be able to create audio ads with a short phone call (like leaving voice mail) and then target them to listeners in a specific zip code on popular radio stations like 1010 WINS and WFAN. With the hyper-targeting in TargetSpot, a thousand listeners to a particular radio show could hear a thousand different ads.  TargetSpot was very fortunate to attract Doug Perlson, a veteran of the internet advertising network business, to join the Company as its founding CEO. The Company will be owned initially by CBS Radio, Oddcast, Doug Perlson, Union Square Ventures, and Milestone Ventures.  While TargetSpot is initially focused on streaming radio, the technology already works exactly the same in streaming video and we believe that TargetSpot’s long term opportunity is to serve advertisers and content companies who are delivering their ads and programming using Internet streaming technologies. That is a big opportunity and certainly full of well funded competition. But we are confident that the management team, founding partners, and technology platform that TargetSpot s its life with will serve it very well and we are excited to be part of this exciting new Company.

Reserves,fredwilson,2007-04-12 05:58:42,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"In early stage investing, one of the most critical things is the ability to continue to participate in the follow on rounds to protect your ownership interest. I learned this the hard way fairly early in my career when I was helping to manage a small fund ($25mm) and we couldn't put more than $2.5mm into each investment.  We'd start with something like $750k to $1mm in our original investment and then take our pro-rata share of the follow-on rounds. It usually worked out, but sometimes it didn't. And when it didn't work out, it was painful.   There are always deals in a fund that just take a longer time and more money to get where they want to go. Most venture deals have an A round, a B round, and a C round. A few end up with E, F, and G rounds. And that doesn't necessarily make them bad investments. In fact, some of my very best investments, like Multex, Bigfoot Interactive, comScore, to mention a few of them, fall into this category. All of them produced or will produce 5-10x returns on the entire investment. But it is also true of all of these companies that the very best returns were to be had in the last round, the proverbial ""Z round"".  And when you put up the first money, stick with the investment for close to ten years, provide leadership on the board, recruit the new investors, etc, etc, and then can't participate in the last round (or can't participate for your share), it hurts. Said another way, sometimes all the work you do for five years is just the setup for the best investment opportunity, the last round, and smart VCs will make sure they have sufficient reserves to pounce on those opportunities when they show up in their portfolios.  At Union Square Ventures, we are fully aware that a subset of our investments, maybe no more than 20% of them, will require more money than anyone can predict. And we are reserving for those opportunities. In fact, Andrew is in the middle of building a spreadsheet that will allow us to do some pretty interesting work around our reserves. RIght now, it's pretty basic. We lay out each investment, how much we've invested to date, and then project the timing and probabilities of the future rounds and our share of them.  Andrew pointed out that we could do a monte carlo analysis around this data set. I am not a huge fan of monte carlo analysis, preferring a simple expected value analysis, but once we have the data, we can do most anything we want to with it.  Our style of investing, which often involves Union Square Ventures participating in the angel round, then leading the first venture round, requires that we start with fairly modest investment amounts. We talked about this in our deal size post last fall. To date, we have made eleven investments (one has yet to be announced but hopefully will be shortly).  Our average investment in these eleven companies is $2mm, but we have as little as $275k in invested and as much as $6mm invested. We are modelling how these small $275k investments can turn into the $6mm+ positions we need to effectively invest a $125mm fund.  Our gut instinct, based on Brad and my combined 35 years in the  VC business, is that we'll have plenty of opportunities to ""go big"" in our companies when the time is right. But our model is a bit different than the average venture firm that starts with a typical $3mm investment and grows from there.  So modelling this out, getting our heads around the appropriate level of reserves, and setting up the fund to ""pounce on the Z rounds"" is a great exercise and I am glad we are doing it. But one thing is for sure, even when we finish the analysis, we are going to add a reserve on top of that.  Because you never know how much money you'll need for some of your best investments."
Cash Flow Forecasting Isn't What It Used To Be,BradUSV,2007-04-13 15:18:04,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"I share Fred’s determination never to miss out on a later round investment in a company we have nurtured because we do not have adequate reserves. For me, however, the more interesting insight that came out of the exercise of planning our reserves was that this process is different and in some ways more difficult that it used to be. 
In the past, most venture backed start-ups in the Information Technology space had a common trajectory. It took a year to eighteen months of development to bring a product to market, another year to establish distribution channels, and then a couple more years to get to sustainable profitability. The capital requirements to fund this trajectory varied depending on the nature of the product, but were reasonably predictable within each segment. 
It was also fairly easy to forecast liquidity. Roughly one third of the investments would deliver the vast majority of your returns. One third you’d get your money back. And one third you’d lose your shirt. If the technology never worked you’d stop funding after the initial development phase. If it worked but was undifferentiated and late, you’d stop funding after the second phase. Rarely would you go deep into the third phase in a company that was ultimately unsuccessful. 
So across a portfolio of 15 -20 companies, you could model expected cash flows reasonably accurately over the life of the fund. Today it seems harder to do that.
We have talked a lot in this blog about the fundamental transformation taking place in our economy as a result of commoditized information technology and ubiquitous connectivity. We think this is a very exciting time to be investing in early stage web services. We believe that a number of important and valuable companies will be created over the next few years, and we expect to be a part of some of them.  But these companies are different. They are more capital efficient. Their success is often built on a network effect rather than proprietary and defensible technology.  It is, as a result, harder to predict their capital requirements. It is even hard to predict liquidity, even across a portfolio of 15- 20 companies.
Del.icio.us is an interesting case study. We certainly expected to have more than one opportunity to invest in Del.icio.us. But when Joshua received an attractive offer to sell the company during the Series B fundraising process, he weighed the incremental dilution of a Series B against the likelihood of greater value in the future and made a choice.  He was in the position to make that choice because Del.icio.us had proven its value to its users and built a defensible network with very little capital. If it had taken $2-3m in development funding before launch, he would have been facing different economics.  
Another factor in this equation is a realistic assessment of the synergies possible through merging a company like De.icio.us with an established portal. In the old days, it was very obvious that if Cisco bought a switch company and dropped it into the bag of each of their sales people around the world, they could dramatically increase sales over night. It is not as obvious that a web service that has already achieved a defensible network effect benefits in the same way by being integrated into a portal.  
So what does all this say about cash flow forecasting for an early stage venture capital firm that focuses on web services?  It says that it is going to be very hard.  The capital efficiency of web services means that few experienced entrepreneurs are going to take a large investment before testing their services in the market. Once the services have proven themselves the entrepreneurs may choose to sell early rather than take the dilution of subsequent rounds. On the other hand, if there are few obvious synergies to be gained by combining a successful web service with an established web portal, they may be very interested in a deal which gives them some liquidity but allows them to remain independent and keep an option on a bigger upside.  So in some of our portfolio companies, we may not be able to get as much money to work as we’d like and in others we may be able to invest more than the company needs to fund operations. And there is no way to decide which companies are which up front.
At Union Square Ventures we raised a smaller fund because we believed that it would be to our advantage to have the flexibility to invest smaller amounts initially. We have tried to adapt our fund to the opportunity that exists today for early stage IT oriented venture capital rather than to change our focus. In a comment on Fred’s post on reserves, Bobby asked “ Why wouldn't you build in a 'reserve capital call option' in your LP agreements”. He is touching on an interesting point. We have already adapted our investment strategy and our fund size to the changing market we operate in. Bobby is asking if it will ultimately change the way venture capitalists structure their agreements with their investors?  I am not sure we know yet the answer to that question, but we do know that forecasting cash flows is a different exercise than it used to be.

Job Board,andrewparker,2007-05-14 16:02:16,1,0,[u'andrewparker'],"Union Square Ventures is launching a job board on our blog. The board contains open positions only at our portfolio companies. If you are interested in our investment thesis and our theories about internet trends, then you would likely enjoy working at one of our portfolio companies.    We built our job board using a product from Indeed called Instant Job Site (IJS).  IJS is a service that allow publishers to create job boards, which can be embedded on the publishers' sites or just hosted at Indeed.  The service is quite flexible; it allows full customization of CSS and header/footer HTML in order to give IJS the same look and feel as a publisher's site. Publishers can set the price of job listings.  If you are a publisher considering implementing a job board; it is an easy and robust option.  You can access our job board from the right sidebar on our blog.  There is a text link to the entire job board, and there is also a sample of a few jobs that are currently open on the board.  We hope advertising on this blog the job openings at our portfolio companies will provide our portfolio companies with a highly targeted set of leads. If you are actively seeking a new job, or just curious about potential openings, please check it out.

Who do you trust to edit your news?,BradUSV,2007-05-21 11:12:15,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"I can’t say that the panel discussion – Web 2.0: Cult of the Amateur?  A Debate – was the most interesting or even the most entertaining session at the Personal Democracy Forum held last Friday in New York. That honor would have to go to Larry Lessig, Yochai Benkler, or Seth Godin, but the debate between Andrew Keen, the author of The Cult of the Amateur: How Today’s Internet is Assaulting Our Culture, and Clay Shirky, Craig Newmark, and Robert Scoble, produced the insight that kept rattling around in my head all weekend.   Andrew Keen argued that the editorial function of traditional media is critical to maintaining quality, and the recent rise of user generated content is lowering the overall quality of programming on the web.  He also made the point that there is no fact checking in the blogosphere, so that you cannot trust anything on the web.   Robert Scoble shot back that if he posts something on his blog that is untrue, in less than 15 minutes, he will have 49 comments pointing out the inaccuracy.   This was the insight that I have been mulling over.  There is an editorial process on the web – it just happens after something is published, not before.  Now, that is blindingly obvious to everyone who has been blogging for the last several years, but the revelation for me is that all content goes through some form of editorial process, the difference on the web is that the process plays out in the open.   Fashion magazines are notorious for favoring big advertisers with big editorial coverage. The family that owns the Wall Street Journal is balking at accepting a huge offer from Rupert Murdoch because they worry about how he will influence the editorial coverage in that paper.   The question is really who do you trust to edit the information you use to make decisions in your life? Yes, the editorial process on the web is messy, sometimes even ugly, but it happens in front of you, so in the end,  you have no one to blame other than yourself, if you end up relying on information that tainted, or skewed, or just plain wrong.   Craig Newmark captured the essence of this idea by reminding us of Churchill's famous dictum: ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.""   Editing after publishing is terribly inefficient, but is better than the alternatives.

Dick Costolo on Wallstrip,andrewparker,2007-05-25 11:20:05,1,0,[u'andrewparker'],"Dick Costolo, the CEO of FeedBurner, was interviewed today on Wallstrip.  The interview is an entertaining summary that explains what FeedBurner does, why it's important, and how it makes money.  "
FeedBurner Is Acquired by Google,fredwilson,2007-05-30 10:49:25,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"This is hardly a surprise since rumors of this deal have been all over the blog world for the better part of the past month. But it is true that FeedBurner has been acquired by Google. The price has not been disclosed, but the return to Union Square Ventures was close to three times our invested capital in less than 18 months.  The financial return on this investment, like many of our investments, pales in comparison to the returns we’ve gained both personally and professionally though our involvement with FeedBurner.  According to FeedBurner founder and CEO Dick Costolo, I was one of the first hundred people to use FeedBurner’s service when it launched in early 2004. I was hooked instantly. The whole thing about blogs and feeds was new to me. I understood that people could subscribe to my blog and receive updates every time I posted through the use of a feed. But I had no idea how many people were actually doing that. And I wanted to know.  So I started running my feed through FeedBurner. The insights I got from my FeedBurner dashboard allowed me to quickly understand who was reading what. I was able to see my readership grow, and I was able to see what topics were of the most interest.  About a year after I started using FeedBurner, they started offering the ability to run ads in feeds. That’s when I understood where this was all going. It hit me that content was not going to live on a single page anymore. It was going to be syndicated all over the web using feed technology and that the ads would be syndicated along with the content. That led to our early insights into the distributed media landscape that we now find ourselves in the midst of.  By late 2005, it was obvious that we needed to be invested in FeedBurner. There were already a very solid group of VC investors including Portage, DFJ, Mobius, and Sutter Hill involved in FeedBurner. But we convinced FeedBurner and the other investors that Union Square Ventures could add value, and they let us invest.  I think we’ve added significant value to FeedBurner, and it’s been mutual. FeedBurner has helped a number of our portfolio companies as well. Along the way, we’ve gotten to know the entire founding team really well and a number of the senior management team too. FeedBurner is one of those companies you can’t help but like and root for. They have a sense of humor, they have a sense of responsibility for their service, and they understand how to play nice in the Internet ecosystem.  Now they will be part of Google. It’s a good match. For all of FeedBurner’s success, monetizing the feeds has been a struggle. The inventory they manage always seems to grow so much faster than the advertising they sell. Their self service advertising system never really took off, and that made it even harder to monetize all the inventory they manage.  Google is the king of monetization and has a self service advertising system that is the envy of everyone in the advertising business. FeedBurner fits like a glove into the Google advertising system, adding feeds to the growing number of places an advertiser can reach audiences through the AdWords system.  It always seems to be bittersweet when a portfolio company is sold. We’ll miss the daily emails from Dick and his team. We’ll miss the ability to engage in the strategic development of the company. And we’ll miss being on the inside of a company central to the development of the distributed media model.   But it’s important to remember that starting companies and building businesses is ultimately about making money. We were able to do that because of the insights and hard work of the founders and managers of FeedBurner. We’d like to thank them and congratulate them on a job well done.

"Wesabe Is More Than A ""Personal"" Financial Service",BradUSV,2007-06-20 13:30:17,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Last fall when we started looking seriously at personal financial services, we realized something important about that kind of personal productivity application and the web. When you move word processing from the desktop to the web not much happens. Writely (now Google) is still a functional utility. It may be accessible from an internet café, it may be a little easier to share authoring in some cases, but it is still basically a word processor. When you move a personal financial management system to the web, it becomes more than ""personal"".  Balancing your checkbook using desktop software is a lonely pursuit. You may feel better knowing where your money went, and even have some idea about how you did against your budget, but you haven’t learned much more than that. Your relationship with your software is defined. It is a utility. Its value is limited. The best it can do is save you a little time each month when you plow through an unhappy chore.   On the web it can be a whole different story. If you manage your expenses on a web based service you have the opportunity to contribute to community and to take advantage of its collective wisdom. Allowing your service provider to aggregate  data anonymously makes it possible for that provider to deliver a service that is better than desktop software in a number of important ways.   1)	Providing very useful analytics, that compare your behavior to others like you. Do you spend more or less than most folks in your community for cable television, or lawn care?   2)	More information about the vendors you use every day.  Is it going to cost you more to bounce a check at Wells Fargo or at Wachovia? The answer turns out to be less than obvious.   3)	Information about how others feel about service providers in your world. It turns out that many folks are willing to say how they feel about the places they spend their money. Would it help you to know that of the three dry cleaners in your neighborhood, one had a 100% satisfaction rate?   4)	Peer produced data categorization and cleansing. I have given up using my annual gold card statement from American Express, because half of the vendors are listed as an unrecognizable string of characters, and even when they get the vendor right, they often do not put that vendor in the right category.  Once I contribute my data to a co-op, a lot of these things are fixed much more easily. If anyone participating in the community recognizes an incomprehensible string of characters as “Whole Foods” and makes the change in their account, everyone in the community benefits from their contribution. After three or four people do it, the service provider can  making the change. If most people categorize expenses in certain ways, the service provider can usefully suggest categories, and auto-fill entries to speed you on your way.  5)	The ability to import other data into the community to make it possible for you to automatically compare your spending against a personal goal. Would your behavior change if you could benchmark your current spending patterns against a respected environmental group’s rating of your vendors based on their ment to sustainability?  All of this is possible on the web because the architecture of the web enables data sharing and re-use. Trying to do this with a desktop application would be next to impossible.  There are other benefits of moving personal financial services to the web. Using a web based financial services provider makes the notion of personal financial services less personal and more communal.  Managing your finances within a community allows you to share your goals with others and learn form their experiences and to share yours.  Many of these folks have grappled with financial challenges like yours. Everyone wants to be able to be able to send their kids to college. Would it be helpful to know how other people in similar circumstances did that? So you get the idea. When you move word processing onto the web not much changes; when you move personal financial services onto the web everything does. Once we realized that we started looking in earnest for an opportunity to invest in a service provider in this space.  We talked with a number of companies before deciding that Wesabe was by far the best investment opportunity in this important emerging market.  We considered a number of different criteria.   1)	First and foremost we wanted to back a team that had a deep understanding of the web. We were emphatically not looking for an “online Quicken”. The idea of moving a functional utility like Quicken to the web without fundamentally changing it to take advantage of the unique characteristics of the web is just plain dumb. We wanted an implementation that recognized the value of the al data set. This is not survey data. It is not a community member saying I plan to do this. It is about what they did. When I discussed this with Joshua Schacter, the founder of del.icio.us, the first thing he said was “you can’t spam it”. No one is going to buy an extra pair of shoes to change their status in the community, or at least they are not going to do it for very long. We were also looking for a team that had an intuitive feel for how to package that data in ways that were immediately useful to the members of the community.   2)	It was critical to us to find a group that understood and respected their user’s interest in this data. We were very impressed with Marc Hedlund and Jason Knight’s approach to privacy. It would have been easier to work with an aggregator to import data into the system, but that would have required a member to upload their user name and password to the service provider. Instead they engineered a way to leave that very sensitive data on the user’s desktop. We were also impressed with Marc and Jason’s ment to make the data portable. In striking contrast to the roach motel data strategy of many providers, they built an export from Wesabe feature into their very first release. All of the work a user does to clean and organize their data in Wesabe’s system is exportable at any time.  3)	We wanted to invest in the leader in this new market. We learned from our experience with del.icio.us that the early adopters of web services respect the authentic category creator. Soon after the value of del.icio.us became broadly recognized, there were a number of fast followers, many of whom had arguably better interfaces and features, but it had little impact on del.icio.us' continued growth.  We recognized that this would be a network effect business, and that the company that was able to reach a critical mass early would be likely to maintain that advantage, so investing in a company whose service was launched and where users were already contributing was important. Google's early lead in search marketing has allowed it to continue to prosper. They still get 80% more revenue per search than Yahoo. Wesabe was founded in December of 2005, launched in November of last year, and recently establishing itself as the category creator.  It has substantially more users and more s, and more dollars flowing through its system than anyone else in the category.  4)	We were looking for a team that had experience and skills to be able to define this novel service and to deliver it at scale. Marc is an excellent engineering manager and technical visionary. He has over his career been consistently able to attract great engineers, motivate them to take on hairy projects, and then to manage those projects to a successful conclusion. Jason is a consummate marketer with unusual breadth that comes from having worked not only in a range of industries but across cultures as well.   5)	Finally, we wanted to back a team that was doing this for the right reason. Fred posted some time ago about motivation and entrepreneurship. Jason and Marc launched Wesabe because they were convinced that they could combine their skills to support a community of users who could help each other reach their financial goals.  So, we are thrilled to confirm that we did lead the Series A investment in Wesabe. We are excited about the opportunity to fundamentally transform the way people manage their money. We are pleased that we had the opportunity to invest in the early leader in the space and to be working with both two great entrepreneurs and OATV, the firm that made the seed investment in Wesabe.

Introducing Albert Wenger,fredwilson,2007-06-25 18:42:08,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We actually don't need to introduce Albert Wenger to many of you who are involved with Union Square Ventures on a regular basis. Albert was the President of del.icio.us and is on the Board of Etsy. He's been at most, if not all, of our Sessions Events and Annual Meetings. Most importantly, he's been a friend and advisor to our firm from the very start.  We are formalizing a role for Albert that he's been filling for a good while already. We are calling it a Venture Partner because that's the prevailing term in the venture capital business for what Albert will do for us. But frankly we like to think that he'll just continue to be Albert and we'll continue to rely on him to do the things he's always done for us.  Specifically, Albert will continue to work with me (Fred) on our investment in Etsy and he will also represent Union Square Ventures on the board of our next investment which we have closed and will announce shortly.  We hope that we will find a few more investments that Albert can work on with us over the next year. He's brings so much to the table. He's been an entrepreneur, he's run an incubator, he's been a CTO, a President, and he's in the middle of starting another company with his wife Susan. If that doesn't sound like a dream resume for working with startups, I don't know what is.  Please join us in welcoming Albert to our firm. And if you have an interesting startup and want to get Albert involved, he can be reached through our office."
Clickable,albertwenger,2007-07-02 08:43:14,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Advertising used to be a fairly simple affair for many smaller businesses. Simple because the choices that had to be made were generally limited, occurred infrequently and were not based on a lot of data.  For instance, a business owner would decide once a year how big a listing to have in the yellow pages (most likely the same listing as last year and the year before that) with essentially no data to go on other than the price of the listing itself.  Online advertising changed all of that dramatically, at least in theory. Suddenly, there was a myriad of decisions to be made from choosing ad networks to keywords to bid prices.  The decisions could be adjusted frequently (in fact in realtime).  On top of that there now was a lot of data available to be analyzed in making these decisions.  So far, however, the reality of online advertising for most small businesses has been much closer to the old yellow pages.  After an initial effort to get going (e.g., picking keywords) most campaigns wind up running on autopilot with at best a monthly attempt at tweaking, which generally ignores most of the available data.    Why is that?  For one, it turns out that just pulling all the data together in one place is not so easy.  Many start out with the best of intentions, for instance building spreadsheets, only to abandon them as they are too much effort to keep up to date.  But even those who succeed at pulling the data together find that it's difficult to go from data to information and even harder to go from information to actions.  There are just too many permutations, too many degrees of freedom, too many choices.  This is where Clickable comes in. Clickable provides an online service that not only automates the unthankful data collation task but analyzes all the data to produce easy-to-understand recommendations.  Better yet, it is possible to act on these recommendations (e.g., pause an ineffective keyword) with a single click.  Clickable does all of that with a ""log in and go"" set up, that allows customers to be active within minutes. The user experience is more iTunes than Excel, with Wizards that are consistent across different ad networks.
  
The possibilities for Clickable are very exciting.  Everyone who spends on search engine marketing (and doesn't want to outsource to an agency) is a potential direct customer.  Agencies, in turn, can be Clickable customers, as the service lets them manage a segment of their own customers more efficiently.  Clickable is launching the service with support for PPC campaigns, but it will soon expand to include banners, rich media ads and online video.  As ever more forms of advertising move to an online purchasing and feedback intensive model (e.g., radio ads), Clickable can eventually become a complete solution for managing all advertising spending.  David Kidder and Munish Gandhi, the company founders, are both startup veterans and bring extensive advertising and data warehousing experience to Clickable.  They did an amazing job self-funding through the start of the closed beta and the current round lets them launch the service broadly in the fall.  We are thrilled to have invested in the company's first round of financing and to be working with David, Munish and the team they are putting together."
Twitter,fredwilson,2007-07-25 14:27:25,2,1,"[u'fredwilson', u'KunalTandon']","The Internet is largely a communications medium. It's also used for content distribution, commerce, and a number of other things. But the thing I do most on the Internet is communicate. Via email, Skype, instant messaging, blogging, commenting, and twittering. It makes sense. When you connect 700mm+ of the Earth's inhabitants to a global network, people are going to use it to talk to each other.  There are lots of different ways to communicate on the Internet:    Text/Voice/Video Asynchronous/Synchronous Reply Expected/Reply Optional Private/Group/Public  There is something really powerful about public, asynchronous text communications where a reply is not expected. A great example is blogging. You blog something and it's out there on the Internet for public consumption. Others read it and they either comment or create their own blog post in reaction. Collectively, we engage in a discussion.   The asynchronous aspect of blogging is critical because ""real time"" conversations such as conference calls don't scale past something like 20 people. Keeping the communication public is equally vital. When anything is made totally public with no limitations on who can participate, you create an open market for ideas, thoughts, and opinions.   The optional reply is arguably the most important aspect of this whole new way of communicating--it sets blogging apart from more traditional online communication like email and instant message.   But blogging is not without it's limitations. With a focus on publishing a formal, reverse-chronologically formatted web page, blogging lacks the banter that characterizes most forms of live conversation.   Twittering is an emerging new form of communication on the Internet that changes the expectations associated with other forms of communication and yet it's fundamentally different than blogging. Twitter provides a platform for banter that blogging doesn't and it's available in so many places via IM, mobile text messaging, or the Web that it induces a different sort of behavior. Twitter encourages people to adapt and invent behavior to suit their needs.   This emergent behavior is particularly intriguing. Some of the most interesting platforms on the web have been extended and enhanced by users and now support all kinds of activities and behaviors that the creators of the service never intended. Twitter makes its innovative network for short, asynchronous public communications available via an API for anyone to extend.   If you think about it, Twitter extends short messaging (SMS) style communications to the web and does it in an open way that anyone can build on top of it. I think we’ve only begun to see the kinds of things that can be built on top of a messaging system like this.  After Facebook, I think Twitter is the most interesting API that people are building to these days. Here is one person's list of the top 10 Twitter apps and here is the fan-created wiki with even more. The breadth of activity in the Twitter ecosystem is astounding. Open systems that support emergent behavior are way more likely to become platforms and we are excited by the possibilities of new consumer facing web platforms.   And this is why we are so excited about our investment in Twitter. We reached out to Evan Williams, Jack Dorsey, and Biz Stone, the co-founders of Twitter, earlier this year and told them if they ever decided to spin Twitter out of the Obvious Corporation incubator it started in, that we'd like to be an investor. The timing was fortuitous as they were thinking of doing exactly that. We put together a financing that will allow them to scale the service and connect it to more places.   As we stated when we made our investment in Delicious,  The question everyone asks is ""What is the business model?"" To be completely and totally honest, we don't yet know.  The capital we are investing will go to making Twitter a better, more reliable and robust service. That's what the focus needs to be right now. We'll have plenty of time to figure out the business model and there are many options to choose from.   We are thrilled to be part of a company that is building a new form of communicating on the web. We hope you will join Twitter and participate in this new medium along with us."
AOL/Time Warner buys TACODA,BradUSV,2007-07-23 19:44:33,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We are pleased to announce today that AOL/Time Warner has agreed to buy our portfolio company TACODA. As is always the case with a company you have worked with for years, our excitement for the founders and management team about this great outcome is tempered by knowing that we will no longer have the pleasure of working closely with this great team. Though we have watched other entrepreneurs move on (del.icio.us and Feedburner) we are perhaps slightly more wistful about this  because of our special relationship with TACODA.   Fred and I were both investors in TACODA prior to the formation of Union Square Ventures. We became convinced while kicking around ideas about the media and marketing business with Dave Morgan in 2002 and 2003 that we were in the midst of a seismic shift that was going to create great opportunities for new businesses.  It was the fun we were having working together on TACODA as individual investors that convinced us that we should form Union Square Ventures to go after those opportunities.  But for me, the relationship with TACODA goes back further. I first met Dave Morgan in an elevator in Dallas, Texas in 1995.  And to this day it still the only time I have ever been on the receiving end of an actual elevator pitch. The details paint a picture of Dave. He got on the elevator in running clothes. I was headed down to a cocktail party wearing a name badge. He scanned the elevator saw the badge and immediately introduced himself. By the time, we had ridden 12 floors, I knew that he was working on a business to bridge the gap between the media business and the technology business. To be fair, he did not quite finish the pitch in the elevator. But the fact that he had absolutely no qualms about following me into the cocktail party in his running shorts to secure an invitation to present his ideas in more detail back in my office made a real impression on me. Those ideas were the foundation of Dave’s first company Real Media, one of the first and now as part of 24/7-Real Media still one of the largest ad serving platforms.   So when Dave approached me in April of 2001, it was an easy call to support the development of what became TACODA. Dave’s premise was simple. The internet was real. As it became a more important part of the media mix it was going to be possible for the first time to address advertising to people instead of pages. Dave was convinced that as advertisers began to understand the possibilities of this new medium, they would no longer be satisfied with media properties as a proxy for specific audiences, they would demand that their messages be delivered to that audience regardless of where that audience was at the moment. That insight is the foundation of what is now known as behavioral targeting.  Because our relationship with TACODA predated the formation of Union Square Ventures, it is a little hard to say whether TACODA fits the Union Square Ventures investment strategy of whether the USV investment strategy reflects our experience with TACODA. Either way, TACODA is a poster child for all of the key elements of the UNION Square Ventures investment strategy. 

A technology enabled service business - though it started life as a software company, the business took off when they used their software internally to introduce the first behaviorally targeted advertising network in November of 2004. 
Potential to change the structure of markets – the introduction of paid search fundamentally changed the structure of the advertising market, but it can still only reach people who know what they are looking for. Behavioral targeting has the potential to disrupt the display advertising marketing by making it possible to deliver messages to folks who are receptive, but not necessarily actively looking for something.
Information technology leverage – TACODA is an information technology driven company. They have built the infrastructure to enable them to track hundreds of data points for millions of uses and to be able to organize those users into targetable segments that can be reached on thousands of web sites. That by itself is a technically daunting task but they had to do it in a way that protected the privacy of consumers by ensuring that they do not comingle personally identifiable information. They also had to do it at huge scale without slowing page loads for their partner media sites.
Data asset – At Union Square Ventures, we look for companies that have a data asset. We think that the most valuable data assets are created when users interact with services on the web. The anonymous data that TACODA collects as users use the web is critical to TACODA’s ability to show more useful relevant ads to consumers but, it is the data TACODA gathers as users interact with those messages that allows TACODA to continuously improve their targeting ability, sustaining their competitive advantage in the market.

TACODA has another asset we value in a young company – a strong management team. Dave Morgan is a people magnet. When he started TACODA, employees he had worked with and customers he had sold two followed him to TACODA. But Dave did not surround himself with people who made him comfortable. He invited me and Fred into the deal early on specifically to keep him focused on creating equity value. Dave brought in Curt Viebranz, an experienced media executive, first as a board member, then as the President of TACODA and then, as the organization grew, he asked Curt to take over the CEO role. Since, joining the company full time Curt, the people and the systems that Curt has put in place have made it possible for the company to continue its rapid growth with a minimum of fuss.  So how do we feel about AOL Time Warner’s acquisition of TACODA? We are of course a little saddened to see the end of this run.  TACODA is in a great market with a differentiated and defensible approach. They have a great team who is executing well. There is no question in our mind that they could continue to grow and prosper as an independent company. That said, the combination of TACODA’s seasoned management, technology, database, and experience with behavioral targeting and AOL Time Warner’s reach as a media company and (through Advertising .com) as an ad network, could become the foundation for creating the dominant display ad network on the internet.  So congratulations to Dave, Curt, Mark, Dan, Matt, Gil, and the rest of the team at TACODA, we are convinced that in partnership with AOL Time Warner, you will finish what you started and that a few years from now, people will only vaguely remember that there was once a time in the media business that you had to target pages as a proxy for people.  Good Luck – We will miss you."
Hiring a VP of Engineering or CTO For Non-Techie (First Time) Founders,albertwenger,2007-08-07 20:43:21,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"So you start a web service with some friends.  They do the programming.  You do everything else.  Suddenly the service takes off.  You are thrilled and getting ready to pop open the bubbly.  But then things start to sputter as your service can’t handle the load.  You put the bubbly back in the fridge (unopened) and wonder what to do.  The next day you hire a kick-ass VP of Engineering, the service starts humming again and everyone lives happily ever after.  The End.  Except for the part in which you have no idea where to find a kick-ass VP of Engineering, or how to tell one apart from the hundreds of impostors at your door. So what to do in real life?  Here are some do’s and don’ts (mostly learned the hard way) presented as (only slightly) exaggerated scenarios.  1. I just met this guy.  He’s totally awesome. He can solve all our problems.  I am going to make an offer right away.  Don’t.  First, ask yourself, how many people have I met for this position?  If your answer is less than five, stop right there. You need to see at least five candidates.  And that’s an absolute minimum.  If you are a first-time founder you most likely have no point of comparison and it’s too easy for tech candidates to look great when in fact they are not.  Also, make sure to get as many experienced people involved in the process as you can.  This is where you need to lean on investors, board members, advisors, fellow entrepreneurs, etc.  2. This woman is amazing.  She spent the last 20 years at Monsterously Big Corporation in IT.  She has soo much experience.  I will hire her immediately.  Don’t.  Most people who have been in IT at large corporations have either forgotten or never learned how to get things done on a budget of less than a gazillion dollars and a three year development cycle.  Similarly, you should be wary of candidates coming from academia or a company’s research division.  They tend to be too theoretical for building robust production systems.  Look instead for candidates who have actually delivered at early stage, high growth companies, ideally already in a VP of Engineering / CTO role.  3. Met this candidate.  Blew me away.  Our approach is all wrong.  We have to rewrite everything in [insert programming language / framework here].  That’s how they do it at [insert successful startup here].  Don’t.  Your candidate is likely to be a technology fanatic.  Advocating a complete rewrite without having seen the existing code is not a sign of pragmatism, which is a key trait for actually getting stuff done.  In any case, almost anything can (and has been) built in any language and complete rewrites that never really complete have been the kiss of death for many companies.  4. This engineer was a major contributor to a [insert open source project here].  He wrote a really cool mash-up using our API.  He has great experience in a high traffic environment.  Should I hire him even though we don’t yet have the VP of Engineering?  Do.  Great engineers will be sufficiently self-directed.  Also, there is likely to be much to do if you are really growing, from making small changes to improve performance (those always exist, by the way) to adding new features or writing ancillary systems.  Even if you do find a great engineer, you should, however, resist the temptation to make them the VP of Engineering or CTO.  It takes a pretty different skill set to manage people and process than it does to build stuff.  That is not to say that a great engineering hire can’t step up and fill that position, but it’s much better to let that happen than to force it (in the latter case if it doesn’t work, you have just lost a bunch of time finding the right person and most likely lost a great engineer in the process).  5. We have seen tons of candidates.  It was an exhaustive and exhausting process.  We all love [insert name of kick-ass VP of engineering candidate] but she has three different companies wooing her.  I want to make an aggressive offer with more equity than we had originally planned for this position.  Do.  This is a clear case where the right person will grow the pie by a lot for everyone (in fact, there may not be a pie without the right person), so giving a bit more away makes total sense.  Also, you will still want to have a 1 year cliff for the equity vesting, in case things don’t turn out as hoped for after all.  If you really have to, in order to land the candidate, you might go down to a 6-month cliff, since you will (or should) know after a couple of months whether you made the right hire.   P.S. If you are a VP of Engineering or CTO with the right stuff, please write to us at info@unionsquareventures.com – we love to develop relationships for when the right opportunity comes along.

What I want from Bug Labs,BradUSV,2007-09-06 12:52:02,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"The wraps have started to come off of Bug Labs. Their site is now up and they have begun an active dialogue with enthusiasts that is shaping their design and their development priorities. We invested in Bug Labs because everything we have learned over the past ten years investing in and around the net has convinced us that decentralized, user centric, innovation is a very potent force that will have a huge impact on economic growth for the foreseeable future.    Eric von Hippel, a professor at MIT, and the author of Democratizing Innovation, has been talking about the importance of this phenomenon for over a decade.  In this BBC interview he points out that large enterprises are optimized for efficiency at scale and that because consumers do not adopt innovations all at once, the early market for any innovation is, by definition, small. Eric cites several examples where users have begged manufacturers for a product only to be told that they are freaks, that there is no market for what they want, and the manufacturer has no intention of creating the thing they want.  The users then do what users have always done, they figure out how to build it themselves.   The net has changed this dynamic. By lowering the cost to innovate and to reach consumers, it has unleashed a torrent of user centered innovation. Many of the most interesting things we have invested in have been born of a users desire to solve a problem they have. Del.icio.us, for instance, was created by Joshua Schachter initially to help him remember stuff he had seen on the web.  By using open source tools, Joshua was able to create the functionality of del.icio.us on his own. With a small personal investment in servers and bandwidth, he was able to make that innovation available to anyone on the web.
 
Innovation on the web is flourishing, but most of us still split our time between the virtual and the physical worlds. In the physical world, it is very costly to create new products and to get them to market. Nowhere is this more true than in the world of consumer electronics.   Peter Semmelhack’s key insight was that the structure of the consumer electronics market was not determined by the laws of physics. Rather, it was an artifact of the way the industry had evolved and that it would be possible to fundamentally change the structure of that enormous market if one could lower the cost of creating new devices and of getting those devices to consumers. So Bug Labs is a both a platform for innovation and community that facilitates the sharing of those innovations.  With that background, I’d like to describe, the Bug application I want.  Not only am I an investor; I plan to be a customer (does that sound too much like Hair Club For Men?)   As I describe the application I want, you will likely think there is no market for that combination of components and services, that it is a corner case, or even that I am a nut (Peter thinks so), but this is the whole point.  I do not care what you think. I want this application. I do not need to convince you that it makes sense. I do not even need to convince Peter that it make sense, and I certainly do not need to convince a consumer electronics company. I want it, and Bug Labs is going to give me the platform to build it.   Since I first moved to New York many years ago, I have been riding a bike around the city, not just around the loop in central park but all through the city. It was a way for me to come to grips with the scale and diversity of New York. On those bike rides, I have seen a lot of interesting things. I have looked through a screen door into a laundry in Brooklyn on a hot summer night to see thin asian men in sleeveless tee shirts ironing and folding dress shirts with uncanny efficiency, all the while talking with a cigarette hanging out of their mouth:  an ash growing precariously at the end, but somehow never dropping on the shirt. Another night, a screech owl dive bombed me in Inman Heights Park to draw my attention away from its three chicks perched across the path and experimenting for the first time with their wings. I have also seen things that you might more typically expect in New York like a burglary in progress in Bedford Stuyvesant, or a delivery boy killed on Broadway when he ran into traffic from between two parked cars.   I carry these images around in my head. Perhaps that is the best place for them, but I wish I had recorded them and could now share them with others. So I would like a very small, light weight, helmet mounted video camera. I would like to be able to control that camera with voice commands through a tiny helmet mounted boom mike. I would like the camera to be always recording in to flash memory and recording over previous images when it runs out of room. But I would also like to be able to say “save last 30” or last 60 or whatever, because I never know in advance what I am going to see. Essentially I want the video equivalent of an airliners black box, so that I will always s be able to get at the last few minutes of video.    If you live in the world of gadgets or video you might say, you can get most or all of this today, off the shelf, for a price. I have not seen a helmet mounted camera that can be controlled by voice commands. If you can point me to one, please do. But even if this device can be found, it does nothing to shake my faith in the opportunity for Bug Labs or the inevitability of an open source consumer electronics platform.    The problem is not the components. It is the integration of those components, and the services they connect to. I know that I could find the camera, the mike, a pocket pc or some other controller and the voice recognition software to drive it. There is even a chance that one of you is going to point me to an integration of all these components put out by a specialty video company, but a voice controlled, helmet mounted video camera is just a piece of the application I want.  I like being out in the weather, so I often ride in less than perfect weather. I would like to add a heads up display to the configuration above. It would make it much easier to control the video because I could get visual feedback from my voice prompts to make sure that wind noise or some other problem did not prevent me from “saving last 30”. It would also make it possible to overlay weather maps and radar images that were centered on my location as provided by a GPS chip so that I could decide whether or not to duck into the rib place in Harlem to wait out the thunder shower. If I were to add a compass to this configuration, the controller (or processor) would know where I was looking making it possible to display virtual street signs so that I would not miss the turn to catch the greenway along the Harlem River Drive.   And it would be great if, every time I passed though a Muni Wifi cloud, the device would automatically upload the saved video to my tumblelog on Tumblr.  Then there is communication. Sure I can get a cell phone with a blue tooth head set that will dial home with a voice command. But I often ride while listening to a bootleg Grateful Dead concert MP3 on my iPod (it helps to keep the pace up). Today, if I am going to be late for dinner, I have to get off the bike take out the earbuds, and pull out my phone. Someday, I'd like too add an accelerometer to the mix. With that I could configure my device to send a SMS  to my wife to let her  know that my ride had come to a sudden stop. With GPRS or Wifi connectivity, it could also send her a link to the last 30 seconds of video and my GPS location so that if I had been dumb enough to get myself knocked down by a cab, she would know where I was. If I was wearing a heart monitor for endurance training (unlikely), she could get a pretty good idea of how serious the fall was.  I could keep going, but I think you get the idea. I may be the only person in the world that wants this crazy collection of components and services, but do want it, and there is no reason, other than the current structure of the consumer electronics industry that I can not have it at a reasonable price. Bug labs is on a mission to change that and if nothing else, they have already made my quirky highly personal application plausible.   So now that I have gone first...  What application do you want?  And yes, for those of you who are wondering - I have read Snow Crash and no,  I do not want to be a gargoyle, at least not a full time gargoyle."
There Are No Open Web Services,BradUSV,2007-09-18 18:16:18,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Let's start with a definition. A service is open when anyone can take anything (code, data, etc) from that service and do anything they want with it, without permission from anyone.  You might argue that is an extreme definition. I'd agree. But, anything less that that is not open. It is in some way managed by someone. Even open source software would not meet this definition. Most licenses prohibit folks from taking code and then incorporating that code into proprietary products without contributing their modifications back to the original open source code base. This constraint, this limitation on the openness of an open source system is considered a fair trade. It was consciously designed to perpetuate the collective value of the open source code base.   I can not think of a single open web service. Even services famous for their openness, or thier APIs like Craigslist, Facebook, del.icious, or Google have restrictions on what you can do with their data.  The question is what is the intention behind those restrictions and what is the effect.  Some service providers try to lock in their users by making it difficult for an individual end user to port their investment in one service to another. This is going to end. In networks where the users contribute a substantial amount of the content/value /energy, this adversarial relationship is unsustainable.  The more interesting problem is service providers who place restrictions on their APIs to prevent a newcomer from sucking out their entire data set and replicating their network effect. Seems reasonable but if the restrictions are to tight, they will lose the benefit of others who add value to their user's experience by innovating at the edge - think twittervision or the googlemaps/craigslist mashup. The winners here will be the service providers that strike the right balance between innovation and anarchy. Without any restrictions on the use of code and data, the integrity of the community is at risk - with too many, innovation will grind to a halt (yes I realize there is an embedded assumption here that decentralized innovation trumps centralized innovation - I am convinced it does).  If the architecture is designed to further the interests of the community, it will thrive, if it is designed to further the interests of the community sponsor it will not.  Those of you who know me know that I am a passionate advocate of open systems. But the cacophony of claims of openness is now obscuring the more important point. It is time to get over the idea that the goal is an open architecture. It is not. I live in Manhattan. It is a managed ""architecture"". The stoplights on the street corners constrain our freedom, but we accept them because they make it possible for all of us to move around the city. Language is another model. We live in a society where I am relatively free to say what I want, but I have less freedom to change the meaning of the words I use.  So let's stop debating whether a service is open or not and lets focus on the defining that perfect balance of freedom and structure that will result in vibrant, innovative communities.

I Want a New Platform,albertwenger,2007-09-19 12:26:42,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"One that won’t go away (under load), one that doesn’t keep me up all night (worrying about scaling), one that won’t make me sleep all day (when I should be adding features).  If you have tried to build an Internet site or application recently that needs to work for thousands or tens of thousands of concurrent users you may share this desire.    Why is this still so hard? Why do we find ourselves worrying about locating experts in the dark art of database performance tuning?  Why are we spending time haggling with Rackspace over the price for another set of servers or racking our own servers at Equinix?  Why are we writing our own user management (from scratch)?  Because we are using tools that simply were not made for the job.  Relational databases have gotten faster and better, but their fundamental construct of data stored in rows and neatly parceled out across tables (which frequently need to be joined) does not really match up with either rapid development using some notion of objects or with scaling horizontally using commodity hardware.  Web servers started out by simply providing static content and were then forced into running applications with the result of not doing either particularly well.  Yes, people have been writing new ones to address that, but even those are fundamentally designed to work on a single machine.  The second you go beyond one machine you need separate load balancers, reverse proxies, caches and all sorts of other paraphernalia just to make stuff work together.  Worse yet, the web server, the application and the database are connected to each other via thin straws that were bolted on after the fact with important information either not passed at all or only painfully (e.g., information about which user is requesting a particular set of data).  What about the growing cast of frameworks, like Ruby on Rails, CakePHP, Django, etc?  Don’t they provide a solution to these issues?  Not really.  These frameworks are for the most part about enabling rapid development.  They do great on the add features rapidly front but often make matters worse on the scaling front.  The reason is that they layer more stuff on the very tools that are wrong for the job to  with.    What then is needed?  A platform that is created from the ground up to enable modern web sites and applications.  What would such a platform look like?  It would be hosted and (nearly) infinitely scaleable.  It would provide object storage that’s as simple as saying “here’s an object, store it” (you get back a handle, ideally, if you want a human readable, search engine optimized one).  Later on, retrieval should be something like – “here’s a handle, give me back the object” (with full user level access control baked in).  Stored stuff should be easily indexed so that one could say “give me back all the handles for objects that match this pattern” (and to which the user has access).  The same should work for media:  “Here’s a picture, store it for me with this metadata” and “Find all the pictures for me tagged x.”  Aside from storage there are other useful services the new platform should come with, since essentially every modern web site / application needs them, such user authentication, authorization and access control.  Flexible processing of pretty URLs.  Easy creation and maintenance of page templates.  Ability to send emails and process bounces.  Handling of RSS feeds (inbound and outbound).  Support for mobile access and possibly even voice capabilities.  Code would run inside the platform (this is what Marc Andreessen calls a Level 3 platform) but it would not be cut off from the outside world.  It would have full access to other services that live on the net via web services.  So, for instance, there would be no need for the platform to have its own payment service.  Let me try to head off some potential objections.  Can such a platform be built at all?  Won’t there be problems with distributed s (or some other technical objection)?  Nobody said it would be easy (besides, if it were it wouldn’t be half the fun or represent a big opportunity).  But there is no fundamental impossibility here, especially in a hosted environment and keeping in mind that the goal is not to create a platform on which anything can scale automagically, just a large set of web sites and applications that are currently hand crafted.  For instance, the object storage magic does not have to work for arbitrarily complex objects.  My guess is that the vast majority of sites and applications can live with (fairly) shallow objects based on just a few underlying types.  Isn’t this just a fancy way of saying you want a hosted object-oriented database and didn’t those fail miserably as software products? Just because stuff failed in the past doesn’t mean it won’t work now, especially when circumstances change (the current ugly picture in the credit markets is a reminder that the opposite is equally true).  Won’t folks be completely locked into this platform?  We are not really worried about being locked into MySQL, because we feel that if push came to shove, if we really had to, we could switch to say Postgres or DB2 or Oracle.  This of course is a lot harder to do in practice because in the quest for performance we often resort to using custom SQL extensions that are specific to our current DB.  But it does point to standards as an important way to mitigate lock in and anybody providing a platform like this would do well by working with existing standards where available and promoting new ones where not (e.g. an object storage standard).  A more dramatic way to mitigate lock in might be to offer an open source “community” version of the platform and compete based on hosting the most reliable version.    Hasn’t Amazon has already built this?  Isn’t this S3 and EC2?  S3 and EC2 and the upcoming database service are steps in the right direction.   But they are not nearly as easy to program as the “new” platform (in particular EC2 is really just high speed provisioning of traditional servers).  Amazon could, however, use their pieces to offer something like the new platform.  I am sure there are other objections (look forward to the comments), but those aside, where might this new platform come from?  Marc Andreessen lists companies who are working on it now, including his own Ning, Salesforce and Amazon.  I would not be surprised if folks at google were also thinking about offering something.  Based on their recent announcements, Salesforce seems furthest along in offering a new platform but they have made many idiosyncratic choices which result in high lock in (not to mention that they run an applications business which might compete).  Despite the big guns already working on this, I believe there is still an opportunity for someone new to build the new platform.  It’s the kind of disruptive change that requires throwing overboard a lot of existing assumptions and conventional wisdom and trying something radically different.  It will also require maniacal focus and independence from the needs and influences of existing operations.  Sounds like a startup to me.  UPDATE (December 16, 2007): Amazon has taken the wraps off SimpleDB and it looks promising.  It's schema free and appears very reasonably priced.  If the performance is good this will bring Amazon a big step closer."
Union Square Sessions 3: Hacking Philanthropy,andrewparker,2007-09-26 12:11:24,1,0,[u'andrewparker']," Every so often Union Square Ventures brings together a small group for a day-long conversation about the interplay between technology and society. We call these conversations Union Square Sessions.   Yesterday, we hosted a conversation entitled ""Hacking Philanthropy.""  Hacking is used here as a term of respect as in ""The intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations."" See the Jargon File.  Our idea was to bring together entrepreneurs who have exploited the capabilities of the web to disrupt markets with people working for positive social change in the non-profit sector to see if the same techniques could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of philanthropy and social action.   We would like to thank the great group of energetic and experienced entrepreneurs, technologists, investors, philanthropists, and analysts whose energy and ideas were an inspiration and will, we think, be a useful contribution to the effort to improve the effectiveness of philanthropy and social action.    We hired a stenographer who worked valiantly (desperately) to capture the rapid fire conversation between 40 high energy people. We will know how well Robert did when we get the transcript back in a few days. In any case we will post the transcript here and try to point out some of the ideas we found most compelling. Whether you were with us yesterday, or your first exposure to the conversation is the transcript we encourage you to highlight the points you found useful or important. If you choose to engage elsewhere on the web, you can make sure your contribution becomes part of the conversation by using the tag  ""usvsessions3"".  You'll find more photos here."
Hacking Philanthropy - The Transcript,BradUSV,2007-10-05 11:32:00,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Here is the transcript for the Hacking Philanthropy Sessions event. It was a tough assignment for the transcriptionist. It was a large room  where 40 high powered people were firing ideas back and forth without microphones. So despite a heroic effort, Yochai Benkler's work on peer production came out as ""bank lenders work on pure production."" Even so, I think the transcript will prove to be useful. Just glancing at it this morning for the first time, I was reminded what a great conversation it was. If you were with us for the event, I think you will find the transcript a great memory jogger. If the transcript is your first exposure to the conversation, I am sure that you will find a lot of great insights.   We had a great lesson in the power of peer production when we put the transcript for our first Sessions event up on the blog and someone (we still don't know who) did all of us a great service by reformatting the transcript into a much more readable form. We'd appreciate any help making this transcript more accurate, and readable. If you were at the event and a key thought of yours came out garbled, please feel free to correct it. Even if you were not there, but it is obvious from the context of the phrase that ""medidata"" should be ""metadata"" please fell free to make the change.   We will, of course continue to clean up the transcript as we can but we felt that it was more important to get it up quickly than to make it perfect."
Twilio,albertwenger,2010-02-08 19:56:47,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"One of the great promises of cloud computing is to make things that were previously difficult easy.  Complexity is hidden and a service can be accessed through a simple API and purchased with a credit card.  When that can be achieved, the results are magical.  This is true for consumer services, such as Google maps, but it can also be true for developer-oriented web services.  A great example of this is Twilio.  Twilio hides all the complexity of telephony behind an API that is so simple (only 5 verbs do the bulk of the work) that many applications can literally be created in minutes.  Here are just two quick examples for illustration: Tumblr created a post by phone feature and a developer created a personalized phone assistant.  Twilio also delivers on the other great promise of cloud computing: scalability.  Twilio's servers scale up and down dynamically to handle call volumes with amazing spikes.  This is possible because Twilio itself runs on a cloud platform and has figured out how to run telephony on this platform.  This also means that telephony can become an entirely variable cost endeavor.  Need to set up a temporary call center (e.g. for an emergency) that has to be able to handle thousands of simultaneous calls?  With Twilio this can be accomplished entirely without fixed cost and disappears as soon as the call center is no longer needed.  But Twilio has accomplished even more.  It has made telephony a bona fide citizen of the Internet, by working on the basis of URLs.  This is a profound transformation.  Not only does it mean that web development skills can now be applied to telephony.  But more importantly, telephony is changing from a closed to an open system in which adding new capabilities now becomes as simple as chaining together web service requests.  Check out Twilio Labs to see this in action with their ""Twimlets,"" tiny stateless web services that can be mashed-up with any other application.  Twilio's announcement today of their SMS service has us equally excited.  They've completely streamlined the previously complex, time-consuming and costly process of building an SMS application -- buying short codes, getting carrier approvals, setting up aggregator contracts, figuring out protocols, etc.  Instead of months and thousands of dollars, Twilio SMS takes milliseconds to acquire a phone number, and offers a simple per-message price with no commitments or contracts.  Even better, because Twilio's SMS service is built on the same platform as their voice service, it allows for the seemless integration of the two.  We are thrilled to be supporting the Twilio team as they are working hard to revolutionize telephony.  We led a Series A investment in Twilio that closed in December of last year and were delighted to join a great group of existing investors including Manu Kumar, Mitch Kapor, David Cohen, Chris Sacca and Dave McClure (who joined the board as part of this round).  The funding allows Jeff Lawson, Evan Cooke, John Wolthuis and the rest of the Twilio team to further step up the pace of innovation -- stay tuned for more exciting announcements coming soon.  "
Markets and Philanthropy,BradUSV,2007-10-22 11:07:22,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"It has been three weeks since we hosted a group of technologists and philanthropists to talk about the impact of technology on philanthropy. I have now had a chance to go back through the transcript and to reflect on some of the themes that emerged from the conversation.  I plan to post thoughts on a few of these themes over the next few weeks.   One theme that dominated a great deal of the discussion was the emergence of markets as an organizing principle in philanthropy.  Historically, philanthropy has been dominated by organizations that  gather funds from donors based on mission statement and a prior track record and then distribute those funds to those in need. Once the check was written, the donor’s work was done. The nonprofit shouldered the responsibility to identify areas of opportunity, vet the specific  need, make the donation, and follow up to measure efficacy and finally report back to the donors on the impact of their gift.   Recently we have seen the emergence of a new type of charity, one that radically changes the relationship between donors and recipients. Nonprofits like DonorsChoose and Kiva behave more like marketplaces than traditional charities. This new model allows people in need to post a request for a gift or a loan to the site, and donors to chose which of those needs they would like to fund.  We spent a lot of time talking about why this is happening now, the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and how the emergence of these markets might impact philanthropy in the future.  One theory is that the plunging costs of computing and the increasing ubiquity of connectivity has made it possible to create philanthropic marketplaces inexpensively by lowering the cost of s within those marketplaces. As  cost come down, marketplaces can replace firms (or charities) in more and more applications. Ronald Coase laid the groundwork for a  coast based theory of the firm in a 1937 paper. He hypothesized that firms arose in situations where  costs were too high a portion of the economic output. It is more efficient to direct an employee to produce a budget than it is to find an accountant in an open market, and negotiate a price for them to produce your budget.  It makes perfect sense that organizations (firms) would emerge to aggregate donations and distribute them to people in need in a situation where, it is difficult and costly to identify people in need, to distribute something to them, and then to measure the impact of the donation.  Today, however, the accessibility of information is lowering  costs in many markets, and if the early success of Kiva and DonorsChoose is any indication, it looks like it will have a big impact on philanthropy.  It is much easier today to evaluate a need in a distant place. We are exposed to lots of information about the need every day in the media and are able to put it into the context of other needs. But information technology also makes it possible to have a much more immediate relationship with the person in need. The appeals to sponsor a child have always had a deep emotional resonance, but it was not possible to put every child’s picture in an ad in the NY Times magazine. Today, it is possible to host hundreds of thousands of pictures and stories on the web and to provide tools to for donors to quickly find the appeals that speak most directly to them.   costs also decline with the increase in available market data. When a market oriented system is delivered online, the interaction between the participants is captured in great detail. Every gesture from viewing an appeal, to funding a project is recorded. Making this data available to donors and recipients increases their confidence in the market, thereby increasing their participation. So, if we accept the premise that the increasing liquidity of information lowers  costs and increases the viability, how will the increasing viability of the emergence of markets in philanthropy change the game?    For one, markets can be an order of magnitude more efficient than firms in some circumstances. We have talked before on this blog about the phenomenal efficiency of Craigslist. But, markets, by pushing the work out to the edge where the individual actors may be more motivated and more empowered than they would be within the context  of a firm, does more than just improve efficiency, it can also improve the quality of the experience.  Charles Best of DonorsChoose puts it this way.   We push production to the front-end user in a way that makes them feel  like they are partners with us. So that starts with frontline classroom teachers being the ones to come up with the micro solutions that will most help their students.  And we actually see that these teachers come up with ideas that are far more innovative and creative than any top-down program would be. And we turn to those teachers to help screen and authenticate proposals submitted by teachers in other regions. We turn to the students who benefited to describe the impact of the project rather than having a staff person go in and record things…. The result is our impact reports are far more vivid than an expert might come up with…  And then have donors who do the labor of choosing which ideas ought to be brought to life.   The efficiency, immediacy, authenticity, and emotional resonance of a marketplace seem likely to have an immediate impact on the structure of the philanthropy sector. Leslie Crutchfield stunned the technologists and entrepreneurs in the group when she pointed out that the in the last 40 years, only two organizations, Habitat for Humanities and AmeriCares  , have broken into the top twenty five of the Chronicle of Philanthropy’s annual list of top philanthropies – the Philanthropy 400.  The stability of this group was a surprise to the folks on the for profit side who are used to a world where one third of the top 25 companies on the  Fortune 500 were not in business in 1965 and companies like Google that did not exist 15 years ago. The emergence of marketplace oriented nonprofits could well be the disruptive force that leads a reshuffling of the Philanthropy 400.  There are, however, significant challenges facing this new type of philanthropy. A market only works if there is a reasonable balance between supply and demand.  In financial markets this is called liquidity. Kiva recently found that they had more willing lenders than properly vetted borrowers.  DonorsChoose has the opposite problem. Their site has a number of worthy appeals that have not found donors. Both are working on ways to keep both sides of their market in balance.    Another challenge for markets is managing fraud. In a world dominated by firms (charities) that distribute aid, the firm accepts the responsibility for making sure that the aid reaches the right people. In a pure market structure, that burden shifts to the buyer (lender/donor).  Today, DonorsChoose and Kiva both work very hard to protect their donors/lenders from fraud, so in that sense they are managed markets or lightweight firms. Their ment to minimize fraud is, however, both a cost and a constraint to growth.  It is a cost because most nonprofit marketplaces have decided that they need to invest resources to protect their donors from fraud, and given the breadth of their reach (and the efficiency of the other parts of their business) this can be a considerable portion of their total budget.  It is a constraint to growth because every time they enter a new state, city or country they must either find and vet new partners in those markets or find and vet individual recipients.  We spent a lot of time at the event exploring the possibility that philanthropies could use a peer produced fraud management system like Craigslist. But, Craigslist is able to achieve its efficiencies because it does not promise that it is perfect. It assumes that there are more good people than bad, and they depend on the good people to tell them about the bad people when they find them. So they cannot prevent fraud, but given enough s (and data about those s) and enough loyal users they can do a remarkably good job of minimizing fraud. The problem is that unlike Craigslist, not all of the participants in philanthropy marketplaces are online, so there is not as much data available to combat fraud.   In the third world many potential  recipients don’t have electricity much less computers, so no matter how liquid information is in the west, the lack of electricity, computers, and literacy in the third world makes it difficult to provide feedback about results back to the donors.  Even in the US, DonorsChoose sends teachers a disposable camera so that they can take pictures of children taking advantage of the donated item and then develops those pictures and sends them hand written notes from the students by snail mail to the donor. The donors who receive these packages are effusive about the emotional connection to the students, but still, some “market data” is lost in this analog process.   Without enough data, it is very difficult to use computerized or peer produced mechanisms to manage fraud. If there were perfect information, lenders and donors could look out for themselves. Micro lending sites like Kiva are closer to financial markets, because if a borrower stops making payments on a loan, it is immediately obvious there is a problem. That information is fed back into the market in the same way a default becomes useful market data in traditional loan markets.  With a donation, it is sometimes hard to define a positive outcome, and when you can it is often difficult to quantify.  In financial markets, the success of every  can be measured, and because every  can be tied to a currency, it can be compared to other s in other markets. This makes it possible for investment to move between markets easily. In philanthropy markets, it is not easy to provide meaningful information about the impact of a loan or a gift and there is no way to compare completely different s - there is no currency.   Jonathan Soros pointed out that the lack of standardization in philanthropy markets also makes it difficult to create a marketplace for micro finance securitization. Investing in a security (instead of a person) may seem at odds with the direct relationship that philanthropic or micro finance markets make possible, but it does offer another way to mitigate the risk of fraud. Ideally we’d find a way to preserve the relationship but to protect the lender from fraud by pooling risk.   Philanthropy markets have a number of significant advantages over traditional nonprofits but they will need to find ways to increase the amount of information available to donors and lenders if they are going to continue to grow. Cell phones may become the portal through which the third world participates in philanthropy markets. As the Facebook/Craigslist generation becomes a larger part of the donor community, they may be willing to exchange the radical efficiencies of the marketplace approach, for a less perfect, retrospective, Craigslist-like approach to fraud. If more  data is hosted on servers located in the developed world, there may be enough market data to use the same computerized techniques the credit card companies use today to spot fraud. Kiva and DonorsChoose captured the imagination of the folks at our event, I think, because most people instinctively believe that the immediacy and emotional power of engaging directly with a borrower or recipient and the inherent efficiency of a lean market place approach to philanthropy already outweigh the risks, and that the balance between opportunity and risk will shift further to opportunity as information and information technology becomes more broadly distributed in the developing world.

Tumblr,andrewparker,2007-10-23 12:10:42,1,0,[u'andrewparker'],"I have many locations on the internet where I can point to and say ""that's a piece of me."" There are a number of web services on which I output for my various modes of perception. The music I listen to, articles that interest me, thoughts I share, people I meet, things I see, and everything else are all scattered around the web. Aggregating these pieces of myself from across the web into one location in a simple, clean lifestream should be easy.  Furthermore, using many different web services to express myself online is not common usage; this is fringe behavior at best.  Culling choice images, quotes, ideas, pages, video, and such from both one's own life and from the internet should not involve registering for as many web services as the number of media formats one consumes.  There is something broken about the way I express myself online when every time I want to post something I have to ask myself: ""What tools should I use to best express myself? Does this image belong on Flickr on my blog (or both)?  Should I Twitter this thought or does it require a full-fledged blog post to articulate well?""  It would be far more ideal to just post a piece of media to express myself without worrying about the overhead of how I should post it, what title I should use, where does it fit the context of the data around it, etc...
 
A blog is not an appropriate solution to these problems. I'm sure it works for some people that have gotten used to the overhead involved in blogging.  But, in the past 18 months I have been blogging, I've been surprised by how cumbersome writing a post can be.  Expressing yourself on the internet should be simpler.  The tightly defined conventions and formality involved in maintaining and posting to a blog often get in the way of raw expression. 
 
Considering these problems of personal expression online, Union Square Ventures is excited to announce our latest investment: Tumblr.  Tumblr is the easiest way to express yourself online. The form of expression on Tumblr is called a tumblelog, which (as defined by Wikipedia) is ""a variation of a blog that favors short-form, mixed-media posts."" Tumblelogging exists to express a more ethereal identity. Sometimes a simple image or a snippet of video I find online can say much more about my current opinion, mood, or self-identity than any number of text paragraphs.  Unlike other places to express yourself online, the atomic element at Tumblr is not one medium.  At Flickr the atomic element is the image, at YouTube the atomic element is the video. By contrast, at Tumblr the atomic element is whatever works best for you now.  Really into a Feist song right now?  Can't stop watching the video of a dramatic chipmunk? Want to rebut a NY Times Op-Ed?  Just toss it up on Tumblr. And all types of media are handled correctly and presented elegantly, because your personal expression is a representation of you, so it should look good.
 
That last point about ""looking good"" is not trivial. Personal expression online should be simple, and, more importantly, it should be beautiful. We hear from Etsy sellers all the time that they use Etsy instead of a competitors because Etsy is beautiful, and they want to display their artwork on a site that has respect for aesthetics.  The same is true of personal expression on Tumblr, Tumblr is beautiful, so it's easy to make your random thoughts look good.
 
To clarify what I mean by ""beautiful,"" it’s not beautiful in a way that is distracting (like many beautiful, yet complicated, flash interfaces). Often times interfaces on web services are considered beautiful because they’re interesting and fun to play with (information visualization novelties like “tag clouds”), but these interface are not well-designed for simplicity. By contrast, the beauty in Tumblr is in its simplicity.  Tumblr is well-designed because you don’t feel like there is an interface you’re working with at all… the interface melts away, and you simply get things done quickly, without error, and with gorgeous results.  Self-expression means different things to different people, so Tumblr is flexible to all those  definitions. I've seen many interesting use cases for Tumblr over the past few months: Steve Rubel uses Tumblr to aggregate his shards of web presence into a single lifestream. Steve Ruble has a blog, and uses Tumblr to supplement his blogging. Jake Jarvis aggregates many of this services through Tumblr too, but Jake doesn't have a blog in addition. Tumblr is his blog replacement. Some Tumblr pagers look like photo blogs. Others are a mash of everything imaginable. I like the idea that Tumblr is what people make of it, and so I appreciate the wide range of use cases.  Since the announcement that Union Square Ventures has invested in Tumblr, I've been reading the articles and posts written on the subject and want to address one question I've seen a couple of times: 
 
Q: Are Tumblr and Twitter competitive investments?
 
A: We don't think so. As you can read in our post on investing in Twitter, we see Twitter as a communication platform.  Or, to be more specific, a mobile communication platform.  Many of the design decisions at Twitter (particularly the decision to limit posts to 140 characters) are made to enhance the mobile experience.  There are people the consume Twitter entirely from their mobile phone who have never even visited Twitter.com in a browser.  By contrast, Tumblr strives to be the easiest place to express yourself online, to create your web presence simply and beautifully.  In the designing the best service to tackle their respective missions, both Twitter and Tumblr have become services that enable short-form expression. That's why many people see Tumblr and Twitter as competitive services.  But, this comparison is superficial and does not grasp the goals of each service.  If Twitter succeeds in fulfilling its mobile communications goals, all the problems that Tumblr addresses will still exist; and vice-versa for Tumblr. So, in our opinion, these two investments are not competitive.
 
Fred and I have been tumblelogging aggregated streams of our web presence, which you can follow.  We are delighted to be working with David Karp, the Founder and CEO of Tumblr.  And, we are excited to be investing along side Spark Capital, John Borthwick, Albert Wenger, Fred Seibert, and Jakob Lodwick.  We eagerly anticipate Tumblr's latest release on November 1st.

Why Past Performance Is A Good Predictor Of Future Returns In The Venture Capital Asset Class,fredwilson,2007-11-26 05:35:39,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"I wrote a series of blog posts about venture capital fund performance on my personal weblog several weeks ago. One of the things that came out of that series is the fact that the top quartile of fund managers performs significantly better than the rest of the pack.  There's a saying on wall street that I've heard over the years about asset managers, ""buy the 10 best and forget the rest"". And that is certainly true of the venture capital asset class. If you had bought the 10 best and forgot the rest in venture over the past 20 years, you'd have netted at least 25% annual rates of return, including the ugly years from 1999 to 2003.  So that begs the question about past returns being an indication of future performance. In fact I got a lot of comments on my series of posts about this specific issue. Nik said:  I could guess some of the reasons of why past performance is an indicator of future performance. E.g. self fulfilling prophecy i.e. Sequoia has backed successful companies and I could be successful as well if I were backed by them. As a result, these firms almost get a ROFR on the best plans...  But wanted to hear from you on what else there could be...  Why is it that past performance is such a strong indicator of future performance in the venture capital business?  First, it's largely true in all asset classes. Someone who has been a top performer in the hedge fund or real estate business over the past 10 years is likely to be a top performer for the next 10 years. Just like there are some who are amazing at sports or writing books or playing music, there are some people who are simply great investors. They have that special something that allows them to be better than everyone else. And like great athletes, writers, or musicians, great investors can have slumps. But if you look at the performance of great investors over the long haul, you will see that they can put up long term track records that are consistently better than the average investor in their asset class.  Second, Nik's guess is a big factor in all private markets. Successful investors create an aura of success around them and their firms. It's true of firms like Blackstone, TPG, KKR, and Providence in the buyout business and it's true of firms lik Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, and Matrix in the venture capital business. Successful deals are associated with the firms that were the primary backers. The success of the deals builds the firm's brand. And entrepreneurs want that brand association as much as they want the money that comes with it. It doesn't give the venture firm a ""right of first refusal"" as Nik suggests, but it sure makes it easier to beat the competition, often with a lower price (as long as it's not too much lower).  These two reasons are not specific to venture. And they are the two most commonly cited reasons that past performance is a strong indicator of future returns. But there are a few things that are more specific to the venture capital business that play an important role as well.  If you look at the most successful venture capital firms, you will see that they are usually early stage investors who often are the first institutional money into an investment, the way Kleiner and Sequoia were in Google. Getting that place in the capital structure in an early stage investment is important because it provides access to the management and business that later round investors don't get. Look at the role Accel now has at Facebook. They are involved deeply in the strategic and business decisions that the management of Facebook makes. What comes with that kind of access is a level of knowledge and understanding about an emerging market that you just cannot get sitting on the outside looking in.  The best venture capital investors/firms use their engagement with their portfolio companies and all the entrepreneurs they meet to become smarter about the markets they invest in. Kleiner and Sequoia certainly got to see the search marketing business developing before most other investors did. Accel (and Greylock and Peter Thiel) will certainly understand how social advertising is developing better than most of us on the outside. These insights are incredibly valuable and should lead to a host of additional investments.  Another effect of this close association with portfolio companies is management talent. Look at PayPal. The PayPal alumni network is legendary, having spawned dozens of companies, many of them leading venture investments in the past five years. If you were an early and significant investor in PayPal, as Sequioa was, then you'll know all these talented entrepreneurs and ideally will be able to back them before others get the chance.  A related aspect of this management issue is the subject of ""franchise entrepreneurs"". Some firms will develop relationships with entrepreneurial teams that allow them to back them again and again. We have that kind of relationship with several of the teams that are in our current portfolio. There isn't any kind of ""locked in relationship"" like a 5 record deal in the music business. But the best firms treat their entrepreneurs well and the entrepreneurs will come back deal after deal as long as they feel they are being treated fairly (and visa versa).  So you can see that there is a virtuous cycle of knowledge and relationships that come from being one of the best venture capital firms. Good deals and good teams lead to more good deals and good teams. It's frankly hard to screw it up.  But you can screw it up. There are two common ways I have seen great firms ""screw it up"".   The first is getting too big. When you raise too much money in the venture capital business, two things happen. The first is you have to hire a bunch of partners to manage all the capital. And not everyone will be a world class athlete. So you end up with mediocre investors on your team. And that is a bad thing. Even more problematic is that it's hard to be the first institutional money into a deal when you are managing billions of dollars of venture capital. So other firms come in underneath you in the capital structure and take that pole position with management, and get all the relationships and insights that come with that position.  The second screwup is ""style creep"". It's often related to getting too big, but can be caused by other factors as well. A firm that is a great biotechnology investor may not be a great clean tech investor. A firm that is a great communications equipment investor may not be a great web applications investor. The best firms are known for certain kind of investments and stick to them. They often have partners who have specific market expertise. When firms expand their areas of interest beyond what they are good at and what they know well, it often leads to reduced performance. And their brand can get hurt. Which can have a snowball effect for the same reasons that great performance and great brand produces a virtuous cycle.  So what would I look for if I was investing in venture funds? First, I'd look for investors who have a track record of success over a long period of time. And I mean people, not firms. Then I'd look for a firm that has a small group of such investors. I'd expect that firm to have produced top quartile returns for a series of funds. Then I'd make sure that the investors who were responsible for those returns were still actively engaged in the firm and would be making the majority of future investments. And I'd want to know that the investment strategy of the firm was not changing and that the capital being managed per partner was in the manageable range for first round/lead investments which I believe is around $50 million per partner per fund. If you find that profile in the venture business, buy that fund. Only problem is you can't get into funds that look like that. Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to that problem."
Failure Rates In Early Stage Venture Deals,fredwilson,2007-11-29 10:09:27,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"My friend Jeff Jarvis invited me to talk to his class yesterday. Jeff is doing something really cool. He’s teaching graduate students in journalism school how to be entrepreneurs. So these students graduate with the understanding that they have another option, they don’t have to go work for a media company. If they are so inclined, they can try to start a media company instead.  We had a pretty far ranging conversation but the most interesting part of it was in response to the question “why do startups fail?”  I have seen my share of failure over the years, it’s part of the venture capital business. When we raised our first Union Square Ventures fund, I told prospective investors to expect 1/3 of our investments to fail. I always like the 1/3 rule, which is that 1/3 of the investments will fail, 1/3 will under-perform expectations, and 1/3 will meet expectations. Meeting expectations means 5x to 10x on our money. If you are into math, you can look at it this way:  1/3 average 7.5x – 2.5x
1/3 average 2x – 0.667x
1/3 average 0x – 0x
Total result – 3.2x  The important part of that equation is that you have to have high expectations going into an investment. If your expectations going into a deal are 3x on an average investment, you will fail in the venture business.  In reality, I’ve been able to do better than this over the years. But when talking to investors, it helps to set achievable expectations.   I went back over the past 17 years during which I have been doing deals by myself. During that time period, I have originated, led, and managed 32 investments, about 2 deals per year. I find that is pretty standard in the early stage venture capital business, 2 new deals per year per partner.  Here are the stats:  5x or greater – 11 deals – average 10.2x
1x to 5x – 7 deals – average 2.6x
Failures – 5 deals
Unrealized – 9 deals  Three of the unrealized deals are 1999 vintage Flatiron investments which will almost certainly end up in the 1x to 5x category so if I add them to that category and leave out the six unrealized Union Square investments that I manage, the distribution looks like this:  5x or greater – 11 deals
1x to 5x – 10 deals
Failures – 5 deals  That is decidedly not 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.   It is more like 40%, 40%, 20%.  I doubt that is sustainable going forward. If I take out the six investments I made in the “golden years” of 1996 to 1998, then the numbers look like this.  5x or better – 7 deals – average 7.1x
1x to 5x – 9 deals – average 2.5x (on the 6 realized investments)
Failures – 4 deals  That is 35%, 45%, 20%, which is more like what I’d expect to see from a good early stage investor’s track record.  In my next post, I am going to talk about why startups fail and how to reduce the failure rates."
Why Early Stage Venture Investments Fail,fredwilson,2007-11-30 08:34:53,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"In my last post on failure rates in early stage venture capital, I made the point that every portfolio is going to have failures. I’ve made 32 direct investments (the deals I’ve sourced, led, and managed myself) over the past 17 years. Of those 32 investments, 5 of them have been failures. Those 32 investments includes 6 unrealized Union Square investments I am currently managing and 3 that we’ve sold. If we assume that at least one and possibly two of the unrealized Union Square investments will fail (hopefully not!), then something like 20% of the investments I’ve made are going to be failures. That’s a pretty low failure rate and I am proud of it. I am also proud of the fact that I’ve lost money on investments because until you do, you really aren’t a “seasoned” venture investor. It’s almost a requirement in our business to have lost money. It’s a rite of passage, but also one you want to do very infrequently.  So why do venture investments fail? Well if I look at the ones I’ve been involved in (including deals my partners led but where I shared the pain of loss) there are two primary reasons.  1)	It was a dumb idea and we realized it early on and killed the investment. I’ve only been involved in one investment in this category personally although I’ve lived through a bunch like this over the years in the partnerships I’ve been in.
2)	It was a decent idea but directionally incorrect, it was hugely overfunded, the burn rate was taken to levels way beyond reason, and it became impossible to adapt the business in a financially viable manner.  Four of the five failures I’ve been involved in fit into this second category and probably 2/3 of all the failures I’ve seen “up close ad personal” fit into this category. I don’t blame the entrepreneurs and managers entirely for these failures. The investors and the boards of these companies (ie me) are responsible for failures like this. Entrepreneurs may not have the experience to know the folly of taking burn rates to levels which make “figuring it out” impossible. But we as investors know how high burn rates kill companies and we have a responsibility to fight them at every turn.  This is a lesson that is etched into my brain and into my back with the scars of $20mm losses, bankruptcy filings, and mass layoffs. It’s ugly, painful, and totally and completely avoidable.  My friend Dick Costolo, co-founder of FeedBurner, describes a startup as the process of going down lots of dark alleys only to find that they are dead ends. Dick describes the art of a successful deal as figuring out they are dead ends quickly and trying another and another until you find the one paved with gold.   I like that analogy a lot.  Of the 26 companies that I consider realized or effectively realized in my personal track record, 17 of them made complete transformations or partial transformations of their businesses between the time we invested and the time we sold. That means there a 2/3 chance you’ll have to significantly reinvent your business between the time you take a venture capital investment and when you exit your business.  Here’s an interesting breakdown of the “transformers” versus the “stick to our plan” investments in my personal track record.  Greater than 5x – 11 total investments – 7 transformed, 4 did not
1x to 5x – 10 total investments – 6 transformed, 4 did not
Failures – 5 total investments, 1 transformed, 4 did not
Unrealized Union Square investments – 6 total, 3 transformed, 3 have not  You might think that the home runs had their plan figured out right out of the box and the deals that were less successful were mostly transformers. That’s not the case with the investments I’ve been personally been involved in. It’s about the same ratio for both categories.  But where you really see the value of being nimble is in the failures. All but one failed to transform their business and all but one were unable to do that because of the large unsustainable burn rates they had built up. Even the one business that did transform itself, it went from a low cost business model to a high cost business model and they put themselves in a pickle when the transformation didn’t pan out.  To go back to Dick’s analogy, you can go down lots of blind alleys if the cost of doing so is low. But if you are spending a million dollars on each blind alley, you’ll be out of business in no time.  So it’s pretty clear to me that most venture backed investments don’t fail because the business plan was flawed. In my experience at least 2/3 of all business plans we back are flawed.  Most venture backed investments fail because the venture capital is used to scale the business before the correct business plan is discovered. That scale/burn rate becomes the cancer that kills the business.  I should also say that for businesses that don’t have the benefit of venture capital backing, the reverse is probably true. Almost certainly non-venture backed businesses will not have the ability to get too big too fast. They will mostly fail because they have the wrong business plan and they don’t have the wherewithal to survive for the period of time it takes to figure out the correct one.  Regardless of whether you have taken venture capital or not, capital efficiency and bootstrapping are critical values. You must keep your burn rate low until you can show without a shadow of a doubt that you have a business model that works, can be operated profitably and is ready to be scaled. Then and only then should you step on the gas."
Zynga Game Network,fredwilson,2008-01-15 08:44:36,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"In the middle of last year my friend Mark Pincus stopped by my office to tell me what he'd been up to. Facebook apps it turned out, of course. He said, ""Fred, by this time next year, everything you invest in will be built on top of Facebook"". I cringed. My beloved world wide web eclipsed by Facebook? How could that be?  Six months later, our firm became an investor in Mark's company, called Zynga Game Network. Currently all of Zynga's games run inside social networks, largely Facebook, but also Bebo and several others. And that list of social nets will grow longer in the next few weeks.  So what has changed in the six months since that conversation with Mark? First, we've come to understand how powerful the social net is as a platform for building and launching web apps. More importantly, Mark has shown us a model for a sustainable business operating web apps on top of other's platforms. Zynga has built the largest social game network in the short period of six months. And they've moved beyond Facebook to include the entire social web as their ultimate platform.  What is a social game network? It's a network of online games that you can play with your friends. There have been games on the web since I've been on the web in the early 90s. I was an investor in one of the first really successful web-based game networks, called Gamesville, in the late 90s. Gamesville taught me how good of a business web-based games could be. It was highly profitable when we sold it to Lycos in 1999.  But web-based games have never been able to tap into your social network. When you show up to play a game, you either play it by yourself, solitaire being a good example, or with people you don't know. What if you could decide to play poker after dinner on Tuesday night and instead of heading over to your friend's house, you simply ""poke"" your friends on Facebook and play from the comfort of your living room? Zynga Game Network has been offering that exact experience with it's hugely successful Texas Hold 'Em game on Facebook where almost 400,000 people play poker on Facebook every day, sometimes over 25,000 at the same time.  Some of Zynga's other games on Facebook are Triumph, Blackjack, Attack, Scramble, and Diveman. Other games in the Zynga Game Network include Battleship, Texas Hold'Em, Triumph and Stickerz on Bebo, and Texas Hold'Em on Friendster. In total, the games in the Zynga Game Network have been installed over 10 million times and reach almost 700,000 unique game players every day.  Building a game network on top of the social web is a big idea. It starts with great games, both real time like poker and blackjack and turn based like Scramble. But the most important thing is to plug into the apis of the various social networks so that you can easily find out which of your friends are online and ready to play with you. Doing both well is hard and to date, no company other than Zynga Game Network has done that with multiple games on multiple networks. You can log into Texas Hold'em on Bebo and play with your friends who are Facebook. That's jut a preview of what social gaming will be like in the coming years.  The financing that we provided Zynga, along with our friends Foundry Group, Avalon, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, and several angels, has already allowed Zynga to double the size of its engineering team and to integrate several other social games and social game developers into their network. Building and supporting games across all of the major social net apis is a costly endeavor but one that we all believe will pay off as game players can access their friends wherever they are at that moment in time.  We are excited to be involved in a company that started as a single Facebook app. Mark is absolutely right that there will be many more companies that we'll invest in going forward that start that way. But more than anything, we are excited to be involved in a company that is bringing your existing friends back into your game playing experiences. It's about time."
Google's Data Asset,BradUSV,2007-12-21 16:07:47,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Tim O’Reilly has been saying for several years that data is the Intel Inside of web services. I am not sure the analogy is completely accurate. The microprocessor plays a different role in a personal computer than data does in a web service. But it was a catchy line, and it made the central point that data is the heart of a web service. Tim’s recent post quotes Marissa Mayer at Google acknowledging that data is critical to Google’s ability to provide more and more contextually relevant web services.  But, the most striking revelation may be that Google is providing 411 services in order to capture phonemes that would enable it to do a better job of searching video (presumably by using voice recognition on the audio track). If this is true, it means that they are providing a fairly complex and expensive service simply to capture a data element that would help them to provide another service. Looked at through this lens, Google is one huge data magnet. All of the services they provide are collecting massive amounts of data.   I do not mean to imply that there is anything wrong with this strategy or with Google’s motives. It is only by collecting this data that they can provide many of the services they offer. Most of the data they collect is not that personal – collecting the inflection in my voice when I make a 411 call (my phonemes) does nothing to harm me – I had no plans for those phonemes anyway.  I am happy to contribute them. Many of Google’s other uses of data are equally harmless. Google’s use of my click-through patterns to increase the relevance of future search returns or to adjust the presentation of paid search text ads is fine with me, but there is something here that I think we need to pay attention to.   Data has this really weird quality. In economic terms data has an increasing marginal utility. Anyone who took Econ 101 knows that most physical objects have a decreasing marginal utility. When it is raining my first umbrella keeps me dry, a second may be handy if the first blows out, but a third is unlikely to be used. This is true of shirts, steaks, houses, of almost anything you can think of except data.   Data has the opposite characteristic. Each incremental point of data adds value to the ones you all ready have. It is easy to see this in the context of an advertising network. If the ad network knows that a user is female it can show more relevant ads. But, If the ad network knows that female’s age, it can do even better, and data about location, household income, and recent web sites visited all add value to the existing data points, making it possible to show more and more relevant ads.  Google’s services all benefit from additional data albeit in different ways.  So what does all this mean about the market for web services. It means that we all need to  to think about the degree to which Google’s enormous data asset will allow it to dominate this important sector   We have for example, been paying a lot of attention to services that help users discover new information and to filter the information they are already trying to consume. The young companies we have looked at in this space all approach the problem differently but they all depend on amassing data about users reactions to information and services in order to improve their ability to anticipate what a user might be interested in seeing. When Google announced their recommendations feature for Google Reader, we had a flurry of discussions about how this would impact the opportunity to provide discovery services. Google’s recommendations feature itself was not that impressive, or immediately useful, but just the way Microsoft’s entrance into a PC software market (often with an inferior product initially) changed the prospects for a startup, Google’s addition of recommendations to Google Reader is a shot across the bow of anyone in the filtering or discovery business. The source of the threat here is a data differential. Google has so much more data at their fingertips that even if a startup does a much better job leveraging data to deliver recommendations, Google could potentially provide a better value proposition to the end user with an inferior algorithm powered by more data, sourced from a broader range of services.   I have to admit that I do not know yet how dominant Google could be in web services, or if their dominance would dampen innovation and hurt consumers, but my bias as a venture capitalist is to believe that innovation thrives in small businesses and is often muted in large organizations. So, I think it is time that we all began to think about how to promote innovation in a world dominated by Google’s massive data store.  Open source and the shift to a web based applications architecture reduced Microsoft’s influence and enabled a new round of innovation on the web.   Google understands the leverage of data. In the one area where they do not have the largest data asset, social networking, they have launched the Open Social initiative to try to make that data accessible to them and to others.  It will be interesting to see how Open Social plays out. I am not convinced that it will alter the balance of power in the social networking space. Open source by itself did not have a huge impact on Microsoft. It was open source in combination with a platform shift from the PC to the web that opened up innovation on the web. Microsoft still dominates the PC platform.  We need an open data movement, but that may not be enough. We may also need a platform shift. The web seems so much like an end state that it is hard to imagine what that platform shift might look like or when it might happen. I am not going to predict the nature or the timing of this platform shift, but I will point out one thing. The data that drives all of the most valuable web services is contributed by users as they interact with these services. The shift that unlocks another era of innovation will occur when users  to understand their role in this ecosystem and have the tools at hand to direct what is now an unconscious contribution in a way that insures continued innovation on their behalf.

New Fund - Same Focus,BradUSV,2008-03-05 11:15:13,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We closed on Union Square Ventures 2008 LP last week.  Our new fund, at $156mm in capital ments, is large enough for us to be able to act on our conviction and to support our portfolio, but small enough to enable us to flexibly build positions in attractive, capital efficient, Web services.  The investment focus of Union Square Ventures 2008 LP remains the same. We are convinced that the information technology enabled transformation of the global economy has only begun. The environment, however, is quite different today than it was when we closed our first fund four years ago. Then, the economy was just emerging from the collapse of the dot com bubble, and the opportunity for Web services like del.icio.us and Feedburner was not yet broadly understood. Today, the global economy seems to be headed into a recession and the market for lightweight Web services is arguably over populated and over invested.   So even though we have not changed where we invest, we continue to evolve how we invest to adapt to the changing market. Today, new Web services are popping up every day. Unfortunately, users only have so much time. Services targeted at Web savvy early adopters, will increasingly need to displace time spent with existing services to gain meaningful traction.  On the other hand, more people all over the world are Web literate creating opportunity for new services designed to appeal to new, untapped, groups of users at work and at home. The potential value of the available audience is also poised to explode as the generation that grew up not knowing a world without the Web is moving out of the back bedroom (and off the dole) into the workforce.   All of this means that you will see subtle changes in the way we invest our new fund. We will be even more selective about the early stage Web services we back, looking for compelling differentiation, a discrete market focus, and clear evidence of sustainable user growth. You will also see us invest selectively in later stage opportunities that we believe are poised to grow as more users become more dependent on the Web to manage their daily lives.   Perhaps the biggest change is that there will be new faces around the office.  Albert Wenger, who has been working closely with us for several years, will be joining us as a partner. Andrew Parker has made himself so essential to the operation of our business that we broke the rules on our two year analyst program and asked him to stay on as an Associate.  We are recruiting a new analyst to take over Andrew’s duties in that area. We are fortunate that we have been able to add to our team without changing the feel of our firm. Albert and Andrew share our passion for start-ups, and our conviction that the Web will continue to be a disruptive force in the global economy.  They also fit well into our collegial culture, where we do our own work, support the entire portfolio, and share the credit and the blame for the outcome.  We are pleased that the closing of Union Square Ventures 2008 LP will enable us to continue doing the work we love. We have a tremendous group of supportive institutional limited partners in our first fund and are thrilled that every one of them is participating in Union Square Ventures 2008 LP.

TargetSpot Raises Series B Round,fredwilson,2008-03-11 13:26:50,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Last year, we helped get a company started called TargetSpot. TargetSpot is the first self serve ad network for streaming audio and internet radio. TargetSpot was built by our portfolio company Oddcast for CBS Radio and they eventually concluded it needed to be an independent company. We stepped into the conversations along with a startup CEO named Doug Perlson, and the four of us; Oddcast, CBS, Doug, and Union Square Ventures put up the seed capital to get TargetSpot going. We posted about that process in April of last year when the seed financing closed.  Now, almost a year later, TargetSpot is a real business. They have signed up over 500 radio stations to use their service to stream ads to their online listeners.  And in recognition of what TargetSpot has achieved and what is ahead of them, the Company announced the closing of an $8.6mm Series B round led by Bain Capital Ventures.  We are very pleased with this financing and the opportunity to work with Bain Capital Ventures and Jeff Glass, the Bain partner who will join TargetSpot's board. We are also very appreciative of the support that CBS and Oddcast have provided TargetSpot in its fist year and of the job that Doug Perlson and the team at TargetSpot has done. A lot has been accomplished in less than a year. Well done everyone."
Disqus,fredwilson,2008-03-17 18:47:30,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We are in the middle of a disruptive change in the media landscape brought on by two-way interactive media. No longer do we simply rely on the New York Times for national news, Dow Jones or Bloomberg for business news, Ziff Davis for technology information, or Entertainment Tonight for the comings and goings in Hollywood. Instead, or in addition, we go to Huffington Post for politics, Seeking Alpha for stock news, TechCrunch for technology news, and PerezHilton for the latest in celebrity gossip. What do Huffington Post, Seeking Alpha, TechCrunch, and PerezHilton have in common? They are all blogs. And, blogs have become a significant part of the media landscape.   This is a big deal. It’s the democratization of the media landscape. But, it’s not completely democratizing because only a small percentage of people will dedicate the time and energy it takes to blog and build a sizable and loyal audience. I know a little bit about that. I’ve built a sizable and loyal audience at AVC, and I spend at least an hour every day, seven days a week, on it. For many of the most successful blogs, it’s a full time endeavor, much like traditional media.  However, blogs typically include a comment link where the readers can weigh in on the post. And, on the best blogs, the comments are where the action is. That’s where you see the real democratization of media. If I write a post about Apple’s new iPhone SDK, I’ll get dozens of comments from people who have spent hours in the SDK who know way more about it than I do. I might even get a comment from someone who was on the team that built the SDK. I am always amazed and humbled by the quality of the information that is shared in the comments to my blog posts.  There is one problem with blog comments – most people don’t read them. The average person who comes to my blog does not read past the front page. The number of people who click on the comment link is maybe 20% of all readers on the very best blogs.  That’s where our most recent investment, Disqus, comes in. Disqus is a “third party comment system” which is a long way of saying that it’s a better way to do comments. Disqus will manage a blog’s comments in the same way that the comment systems provided by the major blog hosts (WordPress, SixApart, and Blogger) do. But, Disqus does a few extra things that make a big difference. First, they take the comments and save them on Disqus.com in addition to the blog.  And they create profiles for the commenters that aren’t tied to the blog hosting system.  Disqus “abstracts” both the comments and the commenters from the blog hosting system.  This allows the comments to go anywhere and everywhere where there is an audience for them. Abstracting comments from the blog hosting platform does for comments what RSS has done for content; it allows the comments to flow freely to whatever place it should most logically be consumed.  Disqus comes out of the YCombinator program. Founders Daniel Ha and Jason Yan were in the summer 2007 YCombinator program, and they launched the Disqus service on YCombinator demo day in August 2007. They asked me to use my AVC weblog to showcase their system that day. I did it without thinking much about it. In truth, it was a big decision, but thankfully it worked out well for both them and me. They got a well known blog to launch on, and I got a much better comment system.  We’ve watched Daniel and Jason develop and improve the Disqus comment system for the past eight months, and we’ve watched them sign up thousands of blogs, many of them popular and widely read. This week, Disqus has launched a major upgrade to their service addressing several interface issues and adding a bunch of new features. We’ve become convinced that Disqus can be the company that unlocks comments from blogs and brings them into the mainstream.  Union Square Ventures was joined by Naval Ravikant, Knights Bridge Capital Partners, and Aydin Senkut, three well-known angel investors, in this first round financing. We are excited to work with them and help Daniel and Jason build Disqus into the company that surfaces the most interesting blog comments and blog commenters.

Structural Change and Marketplaces,albertwenger,2008-03-26 09:58:41,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"There was a brief period of time around 1999/2000 when it seemed that B2B marketplaces would rule the world of commerce, but then most of them collapsed.  Just go to the URLs for three of the big names from back then Chemdex, e-Steel, or PaperExchange and you will find that they have either disappeared or completely changed their model, e.g. from a marketplace to a software vendor.  Does this mean B2B marketplaces were a bad idea per se?  Not necessarily.  A lot has happened since then that increases the viability of marketplaces.  First, many people around the world are now perfectly accustomed to personal s on the Internet, such as buying on Amazon.  This is an important pre-condition to being open to conducting commerce on the Internet.  Briefly put yourself back into the year 1999 – how much of your holiday shopping was online versus offline?  Compare that to the most recent holiday season.  Ask yourself how you feel about transacting online for your business.  Second, there exists an international payment mechanism in the form of PayPal.  This is not to say that PayPal is perfect (far from it), but its global reach is astonishing.  Accepting credit cards online also has become a cinch with several providers offering robust and reasonably priced services.  There are also services aimed specifically at business s, such as Tradecard.  Third, starting a marketplace no longer means spending $20 million on Anderson Consulting to build some monstrous technology.  Instead, a small team can develop a fully functional marketplace using open source.  Keeping cost low during the inevitably slow early days of any marketplace (it’s lonely for the first buyers and sellers) is crucial.  Fourth, due to increased adoption of APIs, companies no longer have to open up their internal systems in order to build customer facing web sites.  This means that instead of horrendous kluges (including import and export via Excel or even manual re-entry) data can now flow easily in and out of operational systems.  But more important than all of the above are structural changes that are ning to occur in the economy.  Most of the marketplaces that were created in the late 90s seemed to assume that simply creating a marketplace would be sufficient to move s online and create a competitive dynamic directly between buyers/customers and sellers/suppliers.  But structures that had evolved over a long time specifically to deal with a lack of information and communication in the pre-Internet age, such as hierarchies, intermediaries, long-term contracts, purchasing departments, and so on, have a lot of inertia and provide value that cannot be replaced in short order.  Now, however, about a decade later, some of these structures are ning to change profoundly.  The most prevalent structure that’s changing is the firm itself.  In many industries, it would appear as if firms were growing ever larger both organically and through mergers and acquisitions (e.g. consolidation in accounting, banking, etc).  But there has also been tremendous activity at the opposite end of the scale. For instance, the US Census Bureau tracks non-employer businesses, which are businesses with no paid employees other than the business owner(s).  The number of such businesses increased from 15.4 million in 1997 to 17 million in 2001 or about 10% in 4 years, but then grew by 20% over the next 4 years to 20.4 million in 2005 (most recent year for which data is available).  The total revenues of such businesses grew even more by a total of 30% from 2001-2005 compared with 9% GDP growth over the same time period.  There are good reasons to believe that structural change to smaller units and individuals will continue and offers opportunities for new marketplaces.  To understand why, it’s useful to ask why firms exist in the first place, i.e. why not everything happens as a  between individuals in a marketplace.  Since Coase first asked this question, several functions of the firm have been identified:

Information sharing and processing -- individuals who compete with each other in a marketplace traditionally have few incentives to share information with each other.  For instance, an independent consultant who has just found out some interesting information on the automotive parts market is traditionally unlikely to share that information with other independent consultants.  Firms change the incentives of individuals who work there in ways that (at least in theory) allow for better information sharing and processing.  For instance, consulting firms routinely make information sharing part of their evaluation and compensation schemes, so that information sharing is explicitly rewarded.

Cooperation and coordination -- inside of a firm it is (within reason) possible for managers to tell employees what to do.  Many tasks require that people know what part of the task they should work on and when in order to manage dependencies and avoid the duplication of effort.  This generally becomes possible inside a firm by paying employees a salary that does not vary too dramatically (within a given job) with which task or timing of a task is assigned to a particular employee.

Selection and reputation -- traditionally it has been difficult for a potential buyer of services to assess the quality of potential suppliers.  If you look at the yellow pages for example, it's impossible to infer the quality from the size of the ad.  Large firms address this problem by becoming carriers of reputation.  It's easier to keep track of the reputation of a few large firms than many individuals.  Firms that do good work presumably grow and their growth sends a signal of quality.  The firm in turn will try to recruit only high quality individuals because low quality work will reflect poorly on the entire firm.

Properly designed Internet marketplaces can address all of the same issues to some degree.  For instance, by capturing information digitally (often as a byproduct of the work that’s done), it becomes possible to share that information at no marginal cost and to provide credit to the originator of the information (by tracking and identifying the source).    Marketplaces don't necessarily have to do better at solving these issues than firms, since they will do much better along a different dimension: Motivation.  As described above, many of the advantages of firms are ""bought"" at the cost of reducing individuals' motivation.  Motivation is a big deal at a time when more and more depends on the productivity of knowledge workers. For instance, most developers will work harder, produce better code and enjoy themselves more when working in a small startup than at a large corporation (the key point of Paul Graham’s recent essay).  What does all of this mean for entrepreneurs and for us?  Entrepreneurs should be on the lookout for structural change as an opportunity for establishing a marketplace.   Human capital intensive industries, such as advertising, consulting, design, engineering, etc, are a good place to look because motivation is paramount and individuals or small firms are already leveraging the Internet to compete.  We too will be looking for such opportunities.  We already have one marketplace investment with Etsy and we like the dynamics of businesses that have network economics (e.g. Tacoda, Targetspot).

Covestor,albertwenger,2008-04-06 22:55:57,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Access to financial markets is fairly open.  All it takes is a bit of money to set up a brokerage account and one can start buying stocks.  Over the last decade the Internet has further opened up access by letting people trade from home (more recently even without commissions) and putting financial data, SEC filings and more at investors’ fingertips.  The result of this accessibility of the markets is that many people try their hand at investing.  Some of them turn out to be exceptionally good.  Probably the most extreme example is of course Warren Buffett who has become the world’s wealthiest individual and accumulated much of his wealth by trading in the public market.  Most of us (myself included), however, are fairly lousy public market investors.  For every great pick we make, we tend to have more than an offsetting number of stinkers.  Of course in talking to friends who would mention anything but the winners?  So how can one tell if one is talking to the next Warren Buffet or simply someone grossly exaggerating their actual track record?  Thanks to Covestor this is now easy.  Covestor publishes the returns achieved by individual investors based on actual trades in their brokerage accounts.  So next time a friend brags about a great trade they made, just tell them that if they are really that good they should go ahead and prove it on Covestor.  Creating a publicly verifiable investment track record with Covestor is really easy.  After signing up for an account with Covestor, all one has to do is provide login credentials for one’s brokerage account (Covestor takes extensive security measures to protect those credentials in transit, does not store them and has only read access to account information).  Covestor does all the rest by automatically extracting holdings and trade data from the account.  Covestor then does all the number crunching necessary to let other investors judge the track record, for instance by graphing it, comparing it to benchmarks and examining stats such as the Sharpe ratio.  One might ask why anybody would want to share their great investment ideas with the world in the form of a detailed track record.  Probably some are doing it simply as a competitive sport.  Many participate because Covestor offers a vibrant community of active investors who learn from each other.  Others, however, do it because they realize the value of an established and verifiable track record.  For now they would have to “monetize” this track record elsewhere, in the same way that great coders don’t get paid for their contributions to open source projects, but the recognition of the community can translate into a promotion or a paid speaking engagement or book contract. We are excited about our investment in Covestor because of the possibility for going much further by creating a platform to enable talented individual investors to compete directly in the trillion dollar market for money management.  Instead of having to join an existing firm or go through the difficult and expensive process of trying to form their own firm, Covestor will handle asset management, and these individual investors will be able to concentrate on picking winning investments.  We are convinced that opening up the asset management market to talented individuals will be as fundamentally disruptive to this huge industry as blogging has been for journalism (what would Mike Arrrington’s or Om Malik’s influence be if they were working for the San Jose Mercury News?).  Covestor will use the funding to build out the “asset management” side of its platform which will permit the successful investors to collect fees.  By doing so, Covestor will fall squarely in the category of new marketplaces that we believe will at least partially supplant what currently happens inside of firms.  We are excited to be investing in Covestor together with Spark Capital and Amadeus Capital. We look forward to working with them and the Covestor founders Rikki Tahta, Perry Blacher, and Simon Veingard."
I (May) Have a New Platform,albertwenger,2008-04-08 09:44:46,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Google has unveiled App Engine and unlike some other recent Google efforts this one feels fully baked and well thought-out.  For starters it includes all the elements that I had identified in my post calling for a new platform, such as a highly scalable DB using a simple storage model that maps well to the common use cases and even support for email processing.  They even provide a fully featured local development environment.  There is a lot here to digest and there may be issues hidden in the terms of service but this is a major milestone in making cloud computing a reality and potentially in breaking down the scalability barrier for startups."
This is Nuts,BradUSV,2008-04-10 19:02:58,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Yesterday the New York Times ran an Op-Ed piece that led with the collapse of the effort to create a hand-held device for managing the 2010 census.   The latest problem is the Census Bureau’s failure— after nearly four years and almost $600 million — to develop a reliable hand-held computer system for counting millions of Americans who are not counted by mail. Census takers will now have to use far less accurate paper and pencil.  The full NYT Opinion piece is here. The AP story is here.  This is more than a technology problem. It's a colossal screw up. But there is an underlying technology problem. There is no easy way to create a purpose built device and integrate it into a new or existing process. The current method requires that the entire device be designed from scratch, all of the components or subsystems sourced anew for each new design. Finally you have to write custom software from scratch to stitch all the components together. It can take months to get a prototype to boot and years to integrate everything into a working product - electrical, mechanical, industrial engineering, manufacturing process engineering, QA, and support. And this is just the device. You then have to integrate that device into a business process and software applications environemnt. Half the time, by the time you are done, the process has changed and the technology embedded in the device is obsolete.  Contrast that to the way web services are built today. Start with the open source LAMP stack, modify slightly for your unique requirements, cut and paste a little Java script to mash up two or three other services on the web and than spend a couple of weeks hacking in a light weight scripting language like Ruby or PHP and presto you have a service that can serve hundreds of thousands of users. With a little more work it can support millions. The foundation of open source software and standard interfaces makes it much easier to create an innovative service and get it into the market quickly and cheaply.   Many of the folks who follow Bug Labs are really jazzed by the potential to scratch their own itch - to create a quirky device that meets a personal need. I wrote about my Bug here. It is great that Bug has captured the imagination of hardware hackers, but Bug is so much more than a modern day Heathkit.   Bugs goal is to create an architecture that would allow anyone (even the Census Bureau) to quickly build a device and integrate it into a service. I am not going to try to design a device for the Census Bureau here, but you could have fun mixing and matching a video camera, a GPS, a touch screen, WIFI and any number of other components to create a device. That, however, is the easy part. The hard part is making all of those components work together in an application. What if you wanted to be able to extract census data from a video interview? How would you pick out an address on a mailbox or a front door and cross check that address with the on board GPS, how could use voice recognition software to create a transcript of the interview and identify key elements of the census questionnaire and correctly populate the a database. Maybe this is a really dumb way to automate a census. That is not the point. The point is that the Bug Labs architecture lowers the cost of failure for the Census Bureau, not just because they can iterate cheaply as they define and then refine their device, but also because all the work they do on the device and on the software is reusable. So even if they end up deciding that their first hardware, software, and service implementation is fatally flawed, they can tweak a little here and there, evolving all three together until they get it right.  That makes a heck of a lot more sense than authorizing another $600mm and sending them off to try again the old way.

AB Meta,BradUSV,2008-04-21 21:29:57,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Over the last two years, our portfolio company Adaptive Blue has become known for its ability to automatically recognize things like books, movies, stocks, and wines on the web. By using semantic analysis to figure out the difference between The Da Vinci Code, the book and The Da Vinci Code, the movie, they are able to provide useful shortcuts that accelerate the experience of surfing the web.   Last night, Adaptive Blue announced an initiative that compliments their top down approach with a drop dead simple bottom’s up approach that can be used by any publisher or blogger who wants to make their content more discoverable and more useful. AB Meta a simple and open format for annotating pages about things. AB Meta complements existing approaches like RDF and Microformats and is eRDF (a flavor of RDF) compliant. Because the format annotates the header and does not require any modification to the page, it is light weight. Because it is less ambitious and not as general as existing formats, it is simpler and more accessible to a blogger who may be familiar with HTML but has never written a line of code.   The Web is changing. It is no longer just a playground for the digerati. As more and more people use the Web every day for everyday things, its power and limitations are both becoming more obvious. Adaptive Blue developed AB Meta in the hopes that, by making annotation simpler and more accessible to the growing group of publishers and bloggers on the Web, it will make the Web more valuable to users.

Wesabe Steps Out,BradUSV,2008-04-24 14:20:10,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Over a year ago when we first started thinking about personal financial management tools on the web, I had this OMG moment when I realized that a web based personal financial management service was going to be way more disruptive than just putting Quicken on the web.  It was immediately obvious that the data buried inside everyone’s personal spending patterns could be an incredibly important asset. It was equally obvious that it was very personal and sensitive data and any company that wanted to aggregate that data would need to have a great deal of respect for their users privacy and for their ownership interest in that data.   Our portfolio company, Wesabe, made two announcements yesterday that demonstrate both how valuable this data can be and how much they respect their user’s rights to the data.   I’ll talk about the second announcement first. The Wesabe Value Engine is a turbocharged Tips tab that incorporates anonymous, aggregate consumer spending data to help you make better decisions. How often have you stood in line waiting to pay the auto dealer before picking up your car and wondered just how much more you are paying than you should be?  All you really want to know is how much you are paying relative to everyone else in your neighborhood, but until now, there was no practical way to aggregate that information and make it available to consumers. Wesabe anonymously aggregates spending data from thousands of “neighbors” so you can now know that, on average, a service visit to the Weatherford BMW dealership costs $700 more than a visit to a visit to Bavarian Professionals and yet users rated Weatherford  17 on a scale of 100 compared to the independent shop’s rating of 96. Aggregating data on spending patterns and satisfaction for the hundreds of merchants and service providers we depend on in our everyday lives, and making that data available to consumers will empower consumers to make better choices with their money. 
 
Looked at from a distance, some might say that we already have thousands of review sites on the web that let us rate everything from grocery stores to plumbers, so why is this fundamentally different? The difference between user contributed reviews and actual user spending data is in some ways obvious and in other ways subtle, but profound. On the obvious side, the first thing Joshua Schachter, the founder of del.icio.us said to me, when I mentioned the idea was “how cool – you can’t spam it”. There are lots of reasons why someone might slant a review, but how many folks would buy more shoes just to promote a shoe store.  The subtle distinction is more interesting.  Someone could give a fancy, expensive restaurant a five star review after visiting only once. That review will be helpful to some, but others might find it a lot more useful to know that the anonymous reviewer of the five star restaurant ate there only once, but visits the unpretentious Italian place down the street five or six times a month. Wesabe freely admits the tips are not perfect, but they are already useful in the many markets where the company has a concentration of users and it will get better and better as more users contribute more data.  I could go on and on about how valuable this data can be. There are a number of other in Wesabe’s post, and there will be more and more as the site grows, but I want to mention the other announcement they made yesterday, the Wesabe Automatic Uploader. This new service makes it possible for a user to input their credentials once and have their accounts automatically uploaded into Wesabe. Now, whenever a user logs into Wesabe, their account data will be there and up to date.  Users have been asking for this level of convenience for a while. It has taken a long time because Wesabe’s ment to user privacy and control made it impossible to use a third party aggregator. Only by investing the time and money to build their own aggregation technology could they meet the ment outlined in their Data Bill of Rights and assure their users that no other provider would store a copy of their data and that if they ever chose to leave the Wesabe service, their data would leave with them. Building their own uploader also allows Wesabe to offer an API, so that the consumers who choose to contribute their data won’t be entirely dependent on Wesabe for innovative new services based on that data.  With the announcement of the new Wesabe Tips tab, the company has enabled consumers to anonymously share spending and satisfaction data, shifting forever the balance of power between merchants and consumers in favor of consumers. By waiting until they could offer the convenience of automatic uploading without compromising their users ownership of their data, they have reinforced their reputation as a trusted partner.

Outside.in Steps It Up,fredwilson,2008-05-20 07:00:12,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Most companies grow in steps. They operate at one level for a while, make good progress, then take a step up, and start operating at a new level.  In the past month, our portfolio company has stepped it up on a number of levels. First and foremost, Mark Josephson joined as CEO and founder Steven Johnson became Executive Chairman. This step had been planned as far back as our original investment, as Steven is a wonderful author who really enjoys writing books, typically one every year. He took a break from that schedule last year but really didn’t want to do it again this year. With Mark in the CEO job, Steven will be able to continue to do the things for Outside.in that he does best; plot strategy, evangelize, and think of new products and services. Mark comes from Seevast/Kanoodle where he was President and before that About.com where he held a number of leadership roles. We think it’s a great fit for Mark and Outside.in and are excited by his decision to join and lead the Company to the next level.  In addition, Outside.in raised a third round of financing, the first of any magnitude as the first two were really seed style financings. This time the Company raised $3 million from the existing investors who have been eager to put more money in the Company as well as several newcomers, most notably the New York City Investment Fund.  The combination of a stronger management team and a full tank of gas takes Outside.in to a new level of operating capacity, just in time to roll out a series of new services that they have been working on for the past six months. Techcrunch and Alley Insider have the details on one of those services, called Radar, and are offering a limited number of alpha invites on their blogs.  If you can't get an invite to Radar from TechCrunch or AlleyInsider and want one, leave a comment on this blog and we'll try to get you one. We can't promise it though."

Chairman and co-founder Marc Hedlund, who previously served as the company’s chief product officer, will assume the role of CEO, effective immediately.  Jason described his decision this way.Last month, my family welcomed the birth of our second child.  He was diagnosed with a respiratory condition that requires ongoing medical attention and care. The past several years with Wesabe have been the most exciting and rewarding of my career, but clearly, during this time, I need to focus my full attention on my family.  Marc has been the visionary behind the Wesabe product, and I have every confidence in his ability to continue to lead the company on the growth path we set together.
We are sorry to lose Jason, but we respect his decision, wish him the best of luck, and hope for his son's speedy recovery."
Pinch Media - Investing on a New Platform,BradUSV,2008-05-29 08:49:45,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"New platforms create new opportunities. One would think that established vendors with big balance sheets, big investments in R&D, and established brands would quickly move onto a meaningful new platform, using their market power to prevent new entrants from creating a defensible beachhead there. But, that rarely seems to happen. More often, the winners are agile young companies who exploit the unique characteristics of that platform to create innovative and differentiated applications and services.  The iPhone is a new platform. On one hand it seems ridiculous to say that about a device that is so new and has such a small share of the mobile phone market.  Earlier this week the New York Times quoted Edward Snyder, an equity analyst, saying that Nokia sells more phones every week than Apple has sold since the introduction of the iPhone. On the other hand, the New York Times was writing about the feverish speculation over the next version of the iPhone expected out next week, because everyone, at some level, understands that Apple has changed the game in the mobile space; subtly but significantly shifting the balance of power in the mobile space away from the carriers.  The release of the iPhone SDK (software development kit) will further open a market to innovation. The iPhone SDK is the first hint of a new, more open platform for the development of applications and services that people carry in their pocket. This is a big deal. It will open up a new market for innovative consumer services and will likely give rise to a slew of new companies architected from the outset to capitalize on the unique capabilities of this new platform.  We expect one of those companies to be Pinch Media. Greg Yardley and Jesse Rohland founded Pinch Media because they were convinced that the confluence of more capable smart phones, high quality mobile web browsers, and open mobile development environments with unique capabilities like location awareness, peer to peer networking, and lots of local storage would lead to an important tipping point. Greg and Jesse are convinced (and they convinced us) that within the next year, consumers who have become jaded by the hobbled capabilities of mobile services will start to see services that are actually more capable and more immediately useful than the ones they have come to know and love on the desktop.  Today, Pinch Media is launching an analytics service to help this new breed of application developer create and tune services for the iPhone market. The company’s services are designed from the ground up to effectively measure the usage characteristics of mobile services exploiting the unique capabilities of the iPhone SDK. Ultimately, the company will offer additional services to developers that will enable them to build profitable relationships with marketers, all without compromising the user’s experience.  We are excited to be working with Greg and Jesse in this new market and pleased to be co-investing with our friends at First Round Capital.  "
And Then There Were Five,fredwilson,2008-06-10 07:15:30,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Back in February, we posted here that we were looking to hire an analyst. We asked anyone who was interested in the position to leave a comment. We received 164 comments and then worked through all of them to find a small group we could actually meet and interview. It was a long process that had a few fits and starts, but we are pleased to announce that we have finally hired our new analyst.  His name is Eric Friedman, and he may be known to many of you as the force behind the Marketing.FM blog. In addition to being an active and excellent blogger, Eric has spent the past couple years at Reprise Media as an Account Manager specializing in SEM, SEO, and Social Media services.  We know that search and social media marketing is the cheapest and best form of marketing for our portfolio companies that there is. And, we've never had an expert in house. Now we do.  So, now Union Square Ventures investment team is five people: Brad, Albert, Andrew, Eric, and me. It's still small enough to fit around the table in Brad's office which happens most mornings.

Internet for Everyone,BradUSV,2008-06-24 13:06:41,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"This morning Union Square Ventures endorsed an initiative called Internet for Everyone. This group does not sponsor specific policies or legislation. Rather, it hopes to build broad popular support for a few basic principles, that hopefully will guide policy choices over the next few years.  Internet for Everyone's principles are:
Access: We agree that every home and business in America must have access to a high-speed, world class communications infrastructure.  Choice: We agree that every consumer must enjoy real choice of high-speed Internet providers to achieve lower prices and higher speeds.  Openness: We agree that every Internet user should have the right to freedom of speech and commerce online in an open market without gatekeepers or discrimination.  Innovation: We agree that the Internet should continue to create good jobs, foster entrepreneurship, spread new ideas and serve as a leading engine of economic growth.  We support this initiative because we believe decentralized, open innovation is not only good social policy, it is critical to our business. We invest in the applications layer of the Internet. Every company in our portfolio depends on open access to consumers. Open access, the ability to put something out there on the Web without asking anyone for permission, is a key driver of innovation on the Web.    In the last five years, the United States has slipped from 4th to 15th place globally in broadband penetration. It should be no surprise that venture capitalists are studying South Korea, where 8 megabits is only an average connection, for insights into multi-player gaming, streaming video, or the digitization of the home. We also find ourselves looking to Japan and Europe, where the wireless networks are more open to innovation, for clues to what will be next in mobile computing.   The United States created the Internet. Our entrepreneurial culture is well suited to creating value at the applications layer on the Web. An infrastructure characterized by Access, Choice, Openness, and Innovation will help make sure we realize that potential."

The Weird Economics of Information,BradUSV,2008-06-02 10:19:32,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Several months ago I ventured into the spooky economics of information with a post that suggested that data had an increasing marginal utility. A number of folks like Albert, who know a whole lot more about economics than I do, argue that it was not exactly an increasing marginal utility, but they acknowledged that there was something weird going on. Relying again on my naiveté, I thought I’d try another post on the weird economics of information.  It is almost certain to be wrong. Hopefully it will be wrong in an interesting and useful way.   I started thinking about this particular problem when I noticed that, at least anecdotally, there was a correlation between how open entrepreneurs were with us and their ultimate success. Simply put the entrepreneurs who are aggressively open in describing their plans seem to do better than the ones who are cagey. There is absolutely no data underneath this observation. It is just my sense after meeting hundreds of entrepreneurs over 15 years as a VC.  If it is true, it could be for lots of reasons. The more experienced an entrepreneur, the more likely they are to understand that ideas are rarely unique, but the ability to assemble a team and execute against that idea is rare. Perhaps they are just more confident, and it is confidence that is correlated with success.  But recently, I have started to think that there might be something more going on.    Many of the better entrepreneurs we know engage anyone they come across about their ideas. On the surface, this seems kind of dumb. Every time you describe your plans, you are providing a blueprint for a competitor. So, why do they do it? My hypothesis is they do it because their experience has taught them that, on average, every time they describe their ideas, they learn more than they reveal, no matter how much they reveal.  And, as a result, they are able to concentrate insight in a way that creates a defensible advantage for them.   Start with the assumption that, in most conversations, the entrepreneur comes into the conversation knowing more about the idea that the person they are talking to? They bring a context, a world view, a mental framework to the conversation that has been shaped by all of the work they have already done and all of the conversations they have already had. The person on the other side of the conversation may bring insights from other disciplines or fresh perspective, but they are unlikely to fully appreciate the importance of their contribution to the core idea. Perhaps when it comes to insight the rich do get richer.  But entrepreneurs don’t just have one conversation, they have hundreds. The more open they are in each of those conversations, the more the person on the other side is likely to engage. They may unconsciously see it is a fair trade, the entrepreneur’s ideas for theirs. The more detailed the conversation the more places for a counterparty to interact. The more they understand about the entrepreneur's plans, the more likely they are to come across other insights from other conversations that would be valuable to the entrepreneur and the more likely they are to pass them along. So an entrepreneur who is aggressively open with his or her ideas builds a very effective network that aggregates data, information, and insights that are immediately relevant to those ideas.  This brings us back to the weird economics of information. Would it be possible to model this mathematically? The image in my head is of network nodes arrayed in a series of concentric circles radiating out from the entrepreneur in the middle. The nodes on the inner circle are people who understand the opportunity and/or the necessary technology best. Nodes on each subsequent circle know the problem less well. As data and information pass from the edge to the middle, it is refined by the experience and/or knowledge of the nodes (people) on the inner circles, so that the ratio between raw data and useful insight moves more and more in favor of insight as you move from the outside in. In this model, the network becomes a very efficient idea refinery and the entrepreneur who is at the center the ultimate synthesizer of the idea.  These networks would be very fluid. Different entrepreneurs pursuing different ideas could include many of the same nodes but they would be at the center of a different network defined by their ideas. The network around the original entrepreneur would also morph as the idea evolved.   All of this suggests that an entrepreneur should be open with everyone, and that they will get the most value out of being open with the people who are most knowledgeable about the particular problem they are trying to solve. The people most knowledgeable about a problem are also the ones best positioned to compete with the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur has more to gain and more to lose by being open with these people. From one perspective, the risks and rewards of being open are perfectly balanced. Every insight comes at the cost of another potential competitor, but that calculus leaves out the whole problem of execution. If an entrepreneur is incrementally more prepared to execute on an idea that the person they are sharing it with, they should still gain even if they engage in an open (and equal) exchange with a potential competitor.  There is, of course, and embedded assumption here. The entrepreneur must be working in a market like the web that is rapidly evolving, where defensibility is based more on an organization’s ability to anticipate and adapt to change, than it is on its ability to defend a proprietary advantage. It makes a lot more sense for Peter to be open about what he is trying to do with Bug Labs, than for the folks at Coke to publish their secret formula. But in the markets we invest in, there seems to be a real advantage to being open. The best entrepreneurs in those markets cultivate huge networks of knowledgeable people and engage them actively to refine their ideas. The companies they build seem to share this characteristic, opening themselves by publishing source code and APIs: betting that they can thrive in an open ecosystem by being able to absorb, process, and capitalize on relevant information better than their competitors.

10gen,albertwenger,2008-07-20 21:56:47,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"My love for computers and software started as a teenager growing up in Germany.  I fondly remember my Apple II which followed my TI 59.  I early on discovered that I could earn money with my programming skills and wound up doing some after school work for Siemens.  While I mostly wrote code on a local machine, I got to do some mainframe stuff in Cobol.  I was struck at the time by how incredibly cool and easy it was to have code running on a machine that was in a different city (Munich) over 100 miles away that reliably and rapidly provided access for thousands of Siemens endusers across the world.  That was almost 25 years ago.  The last 10+ years many of us have struggled with how to create a similar experience for not thousands, but tens or hundreds of thousands or even millions of people over the Internet.  By comparison to my mainframe experience, most of how we have done that has a Rube Goldberg-esque feel to it: Lots of machines running lots of different pieces of software strung together by tons of custom code and all of that is before you get to the application layer.  Last year I wrote a post titled ""I Want a New Platform” which describes in some detail what I believe is wrong with our present stack and what might replace it.  A lot of exciting things have happened since the post in what is rapidly becoming known as “cloud computing.”  Cloud computing will fundamentally transform how software and services on the web are created.  When the cloud is fully realized, developers will no longer have to worry about provisioning and monitoring machines (whether virtual or real) or whether they will be able to handle a 1000-fold increase in load on their service.  A single individual will be able to create a site or service that can affect the lives of many millions or even billions of people.  The undoubted leader in the use of cloud computing is of course Google.  In fact, it appears to be a crucial aspect of Google’s competitive advantage.  Imagine coming up with a better webmail client a la gmail, but not being part of Google – leaving monetization aside for a moment, where would you have run the sucker and made it support millions of users?  One might point to Amazon EC2.  But while EC2 is a great platform for creating and managing machine instances, it does not by itself provide the kind of abstraction that is needed.  Most people who use EC2 today still create instances that essentially contain the same stack that they might otherwise have on more expensive machines at a dedicated hosting provider.  Google has taken some steps of making their cloud computing platform accessible to developers through Google App Engine.  But there are some serious issues with App Engine.  Some of these Google will likely fix, such as having Python as the only available language.  Others are harder to overcome.  What if you are worried about Google competing with your business?  What if you would like to run your code elsewhere?  Given that cloud computing is part of Google’s competitive advantage it’s not clear that Google will want to ever make App Engine as fully fledged and portable as it might otherwise be.  Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen.  They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service.  The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby.  The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.  10gen could be seen as a departure from the kind of investments that we have made. But in fact 10gen fits in well with many of our basic premises.  First, 10gen is attempting to change the structure of a large market, the $20B+ a year hosting industry.  Hosting providers running 10gen will be able to completely abstract away machines and instead provide developers with a platform a la Google App Engine.  Second, it is doing so in a capital efficient manner.  10gen is not investing in physical hardware.  Instead, 10gen is developing the software and services to run on existing hardware that has been built up and continues to accumulate.  Third, 10gen is not looking to traditional sources of defensibility in the form of proprietary closed software or hardware.  10gen is opensourcing the key components of its stack and is actively recruiting contributors (if you are interested, check out the SDK and the contact page).  We look forward to working with Dwight, Eliot, Geir and the team they are building. 10gen has released an alpha SDK in time for OSCON 2008 this week."
Meetup - The Original Web Meets World Company,BradUSV,2008-07-23 09:57:57,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Something is changing on the web. We have lost some of the giddy enthusiasm that has surrounded the web since 2004. It was then that Tim O’Reilly defined Web 2.0 as a platform that leveraged collective intelligence. There is still a ton of interest this idea, but many of the recent conversations we have had about the web are colored by concern.   Though it is not often stated, I think insiders feel the web is coming of age, and they are wondering what’s next. It is not that they expect something new on the scale of the web, but they are worried that the insight that Tim defined – the leverage behind services like Flickr, del.icio.us, Digg, and Twitter – is now broadly understood. They are not surprised there has been a flood of new services trying to mine this vein. The problem is the technically savvy core community of users whose early embrace fueled the growth of these services is running up an attention deficit. Any new service that expects this group to invest time and energy will need to displace the attention those users invest in existing services that have already achieved substantial network effects. That is not going to be easy.  Two things will need to happen if the recent pace of innovation on the web is going to be sustained over the next few years. The next generation of services will need to have an impact on the real world and the real economy, not just an attention economy driven by self expression and discovery online. These new services will also need to reach real people, many of who use few if any web services today.   Tim makes the argument for using the web to attack real world problems in this post: What good is collective intelligence if it doesn’t make us smarter.  Tim’s point is that the hive mind of the blogosphere is useless if the rubber never hits the road. We can post and comment and tweet and tag and follow all we want in cyberspace; but if it ultimately doesn’t change anything in real space, we haven’t really accomplished anything.   ""I've argued all along that the real heart of Web 2.0 is the ability of networked applications to harness collective intelligence. Yes, you can harness collective intelligence to build amazing internet businesses, as the past five years have shown us.   But what good is collective intelligence if it doesn't make us smarter?   In an era of looming scarcities, economic disruption, and the possibility of catastrophic ecological change, it's time for us all to wake up, to take our new ‘superpowers’ seriously, and to use them to solve problems that really matter.""  So in Tim’s view, what’s next is the intersection of cyberspace and real space. John Battelle calls it Web Meets World. We agree with Tim, John, Umair, and everyone else who argues that the real impact of the web will ultimately be in its ability to organize people online to make a difference offline.   But none of these folks make the related point that for the web to have a greater impact going forward it will not only have to touch the real world, it will have to reach real people.  At USV we have been thinking about this challenge for the past several months. Our most recent portfolio company, Meetup, has been thinking about this challenge since it was founded in 2002. Organizing people online to make a difference offline has been the central mission of Meetup since the ning. The team there has always understood that there was a difference between collective intelligence and collective action.   But the folks at Meetup were prescient in another way as well. They knew all along that the web would only reach its potential if it reached real people. Many readers of this blog will have been to tech Meetups. Most know of the political Meetups that powered Howard Deans 2004 campaign, and have informed every politician’s 2008 campaign. What may come as a surprise is that only 1% of Meetups are tech related, and only 5% are politically related. Most address the everyday needs of real people. Meetup, for example, organizes over 2300 moms Meetup groups in 1100 cities in 11 countries.   So we are thrilled to be an investor in a company that has been organized since its inception around the key insight that we believe will drive the next several years of innovation on the web – the need to solve real problems in the real world for real people. But we are pleased to be an investor for many other reasons as well. We have known the founder, Scott Heiferman since 1995. At the ripe old age of 36, he is a veteran of the New York start up scene, with four notches on his belt that I can count. The company he leads today so perfectly embodies our investment thesis that we have often used it as an example. It feels, in a way, like Meetup was always meant to be a Union Square Ventures portfolio company. Many of our other portfolio companies are aligned in spirit if not in practice. Check out these Etsy Meetups.   Obviously we think Meetup is perfectly positioned to lead the web to the world. It is, in many ways,  the original Web Meets World company. It is also a great place to work and is, at the moment, looking for great people to work there.

Zemanta,fredwilson,2008-09-15 10:26:39,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We've invested in a number of blogging related applications and services; Adaptive Blue, Delicious, Disqus, FeedBurner, Outside.in, Twitter, and Tumblr. We've been attracted to this sector for a number of reason; because an increasing amount of content is produced with these kinds of tools and services, because traditional media is increasingly adopting these tools and services themselves, and because our personal usage has given us a deep understanding of these tools and services.  Today we are announcing yet another investment in this sector, a small company in Slovenia and London called Zemanta. Zemanta is a service that's focused on helping the blogger/content creator make the process of creating their content simpler and easier. As you write, Zemanta processes all of your text (like a spell checker in a word processing program does) and suggests things to you. Currently, Zemanta suggests stories/posts/research you might want to read as you compose your post, images you might want to include in the post, words you might want to hyperlink out with, and tags for search engines and other services to use to discover your content.  A number of us at Union Square Ventures have been using the Zemanta service for several months and we universally like it and have found that we feel less equipped when we try to blog without it. Currently you can get the Zemanta service as a free plugin for the following applications and services; Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Live Writer, WordPress, Moveable Type, and Drupal.  Like many of the services we invest in, Zemanta's initial value proposition is significant and has allowed them to reach a critical mass of bloggers. But the potential for Zemanta goes way beyond recommending links, images, and tags. If you think about it, Zemanta is ""adwords for content creators"". And we are eager to see them open up this contextual recommendation engine to other web apps and services that content creators might like to add into their posts at the time of creation. The obvious things would be monetization services (affiliate links, text ads, and even graphical ads), widgets and badges, video, quotes, and music. But honestly the potential for this sort of thing is quite significant and we certainly cannot know for sure where it will ultimately lead.  We were invited to join existing UK investors Eden Ventures and The Accelerator Group (TAG) as seed investors in Zemanta. Zemanta was the winner of last year's seedcamp program in London, which is kicking off again this week in London. We are very pleased to be joining a couple of top notch early stage investors in London in this deal and we are equally excited to add a seedcamp company to our portfolio.   This is our second investment in Europe and it is possibly the first investment in a Slovenian tech company by a US venture capital investor. So we are making a bit of history here and that's exciting too. The founders of Zemanta, Boštjan Špetič and Andraž Tori, are leading members of the Slovenian tech community and have built an amazing team of developers. Our investment will fund the development of a US-based business development team and we are looking for candidates in the bay area and metro NY to join the company. If you are interested, please let us know in the comments or via email.             "
Power to the People,albertwenger,2008-09-22 07:45:10,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"We encourage our portfolio companies to make sure they take time out from the operational demands of their business to think about the bigger strategic picture. We do the same for USV and a couple of weeks ago took a day off to discuss how we think the web itself is changing, how the web is changing industries and society, and as a result how opportunities for startups are changing. One of the best ways we have found to think about change is to identify those principles that appear to drive the change and that themselves can provide a bit of a constant. In other words to understand what’s changing, you need to understand what is staying the same.
To that end we first looked at the characteristics of opportunities that we had set out as far back as 2004: technology leverage, disruption of markets, no gatekeepers, capital efficiency, data asset/network effect defensibility. We believe that all of these still apply and they are all still things that we look for in opportunities. But these also point to important changes. It used to be that mobile was a walled garden environment with the carriers as gatekeepers. Apple’s AppStore and the response to this by other device manufacturers has forced the carriers to reevaluate their role as strict gatekeepers and give more choice to consumers and more opportunity to developers. If Google's Android succeeds it will take that shift toward developers a big step further (in Android the phone applications, such as the dialer, are completely accessible and can even be replaced).
To us, this appears to be one of the great constants of the web. It is taking power away from existing large institutions and pushing it out to smaller entities and often all the way to individuals. In the process it is building up new institutions (such as Google), but the net result appears to be a distinct shift of “power to the people.” We see this at work in many of our existing investments: Etsy’s marketplace for handmade goods lets artists connect directly with buyers; Covestor enables investors to share their track records and discover each other; Wesabe puts folks in control of their finances; Tumblr facilitates sharing oneself; BugLabs lets anyone create a custom network-connected device. In each case, individuals are empowered in ways that simply were not possible prior to the web. 
We believe that the same shift will become increasingly important in other areas of life that have longer standing and slower changing institutions. Take education, for example. For hundreds of years education has essentially been organized around schools and universities. To date, this has even been largely true in distance/online education (e.g., University of Phoenix). It may be difficult for us to conceive of alternatives because we are so used to the existing structures, but these are in no small part based on historical difficulties in disseminating information. Books at one point were super expensive and even the Sorbonne (the oldest still operating university) had only a few hundred in their library. With book digitization proceeding at a rapid pace and most new research publications available electronically, having a library will soon no longer be a reason to have a university. Lectures could historically only be heard at the time and place of the lecture. Now we can watch a video recording of a lecture over the web. A tutor had to be in the same place to look at the work of a student and provide feedback. All of this is of course slightly overstating the restrictions on the flow of information, as there were correspondence based courses even in the age of snail mail, but they accounted for a vanishing fraction of education. In recent years, however, we have seen a significant upswing in home schooling. While other social factors are at work, a key enabler for homeschooling has been the web. With access to course materials, ability to watch lectures and even tutor at a distance, we believe that we are only at the ning of the web’s impact on the fundamental structure of education. We expect much of that change to be away from the existing educational institutions and towards empowering individuals and newly-formed groups.
The environment is another area where the web can enable the kind of structural change that shifts power to individuals. Again much of this is due to the vastly reduced cost of moving information around and acting on it. For instance, the cost of producing electricity depends a lot on the load in the system and on the availability of various sources (e.g. if the wind is blowing). Prior to the web it was difficult, albeit not impossible, to disseminate a fluctuating electricity price to households and give them the ability to act on it. The web makes this almost trivial and can thus enable individuals to adjust their demand. With the web it is even possible for individuals to do this when they are not at home (this being an almost literal example of “power to the people”!). Similarly, it used to be difficult to gather and analyze all the data necessary to understand the environmental impact of a particular activity. The web allows for this to happen in a seamless manner. You book a flight online, the reservation site can query a database and tell you about the carbon footprint. The same could happen for any online purchase. Imagine going to Amazon and comparing two products and seeing not just their price and features, but also their lifecycle environmental impact in an easily comparable fashion. 
The shift away from existing institutions in education, the environment and other areas up for change will not be brought about magically by the web alone, but by companies that use the web to create the right kind of platform. We believe that these represent tremendous startup opportunities over years to come and look forward to meeting with entrepreneurs and teams working to give ""power to the people."" "
Why The Flow Of Innovation Has Reversed,BradUSV,2008-09-29 09:23:33,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"I had a beer recently with Dave McClure of 500 Hats. As is always the case when I get together with Dave, we had a long, rambling and enjoyable conversation about how the Web is changing the way businesses get built.   At some point, I said that the vector of innovation has changed. It used to be that innovation started with NASA, flowed to the military, then to the enterprise, and finally to the consumer. Today, it is the reverse. All of the most interesting stuff is being built first for consumers and is tricking back to the enterprise. I suggested that one reason this is happening is that the success of a web service is more often determined by its social engineering than its electrical engineering.   Dave immediately said he’d give me three months to blog that before he did. I thought that was generous even for me who doesn’t blog easily or often. But just to be sure I make the deadline, here is the post.  The basic insight that the flow of innovation has reversed has been out there as a meme for a while. Fred wrote about it and referenced  Esther Dyson’s Release 1.0 article.  I took a shot at why it was happening; I focused on changes in the way services are built and their complexity. The conversation that Dave and I had was more about how critical the user interface is in consumer facing web services and how that might influence the flow of innovation.  We have marveled more than once on this blog about the remarkable efficiency of Craigslist.  That service is essentially a very lightweight governance system that manages an enormous collection of users who contribute all of the content and much of the oversight that makes the service work. It is because Craig and Jim focus on managing the efforts of their users instead of doing the work of those users that Craigslist is so phenomenally efficient. Many of the most interesting web services are like Craigslist, at their core, lightweight governance systems. Facebook and Twitter come to mind.   Even services that do more than mediate communications among their users often depend on users contributing data through their engagement with the service before they can provide value back to those users. Wesabe can only help users understand their spending and suggest ways to do more with less because users share their spending data with the service. Del.icio.us depends on users tagging the Web in order to be able to help users discover sites, services and memes on the web. Last.fm only works because users share their listening behavior with the service.  In the old days, electrical engineers focused on getting computers to work not on getting people to engage with the systems built on top of those computers.  The folks that built enterprise software were vaguely aware that their systems had to be accessible to the humans that used them but they had a huge advantage. The people who used them did so as part of their job, they were trained to use them and fired if they could not figure them out.   Today, no one tells you to use Facebook. There are no employer sponsored training sessions on the use of del.icio.us. The burden is on the designer of the system to meet a need, entertain, or inform their users. They also have to seduce those users, hiding complexity, revealing one layer at time, always enticing, never intimidating, until the user one day finds they are intimately familiar with power and the pleasures of the service.  Designing a system that does that is not an electrical engineering problem. It is a social engineering problem. The best social engineers are working today on consumer facing web services. They understand that there is enormous potential leverage in those services. The creators of these services recognize that services like theirs will ultimately disrupt the economics of many, if not most, parts of the global economy in much the same way that Craigslist collapsed the multi-billion dollar classified industry into a fabulously profitable multi-million dollar web service.   So that, it seems to me, is one more reason the flow of innovation has reversed.

Return Path,fredwilson,2008-10-30 13:49:37,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Reputation is critical to most businesses, but on the Internet reputation takes on an even more important role. When you do business with a person or a company that you cannot see and you don't know, you really need some data about their reputation. Some of the most successful businesses on the Internet are built on reputation.  eBay, for example, maintains a rating for each and every user in their marketplace that is updated to reflect their reputation in real time. User reputation ratings in eBay are crucial for creating an accountable, safe, and reliable community of buyers and sellers. Google's page rank algorithm, that is the heart of their search engine, effectively measures the reputation of each and every page on the Internet and returns search results sorted by those pages that have the best reputations for a given keyword.  We are constantly looking for investment opportunities in other Internet businesses that are built on reputation and several months ago, we closed an investment in a Company that we know well and have been working with for quite a while already.  That company is called Return Path and they are the leading provider of email sender reputation data, deliverability, and whitelisting through a service called Sender Score. The Sender Score database tracks email senders (using the sending domain and IP address of the mail server that each and every commercial mailer uses to send their email). Return Path captures a host of data points about that sender through relationships with various points in the email flow from sender to receiver. Examples of the kind of data they collect are frequency of mailing, mail volumes, complaints, bounces, and unsubscribe request compliance. In all, Return Path captures about 60 different types of data on over 100 million email senders, being sent to them by over 30 sources representing almost 100 million email users, in real time.  As the name implies, each commercial email sender is given a Sender Score that is dynamic and always changing to reflect the current reputation of that sender. Return Path publishes these Sender Scores to the public at senderscore.org.  If you are curious about the reputation of an email sender that regularly sends you mail, you can find it at senderscore.org by looking them up either by domain or by IP address.  Return Path has built a large business over the past five years servicing the commercial email marketplace with various products that all rely to some extent on email reputation. For example, Return Path's Sender Score Monitor  product is a dashboard service that commercial email senders use to monitor their delivery rates at different ISPs and filters as well as test their emails before campaigns go out to help prevent problems. Monitor uses Sender Score reputation data to explain to commercial mailers why they have delivery problems so they can fix them. Return Path's Sender Score Manager product is a full service version of Monitor that includes expert professional services to provide email senders additional help in managing deliverability and ISP relationships. Return Path's Sender Score Certified is the industry's largest whitelist service that allows mailers with very high Sender Scores (ie reputations) to be assured of getting through spam filters at over 1 billion mailboxes worldwide, from Hotmail to Yahoo, to major corporate filters. In all, Return Path has about a half dozen services - including a number of products and services for ISPs and commercial email filters - and is regularly rolling out new ones.  I've known Return Path since 1999 when my prior firm, Flatiron Partners, invested in the company in its first venture round. I've been on the board of Return Path since 2001 and have watched Return Path build its reputation based email deliverability business into the market-leading provider. Return Path recently made the determination to divest itself of its other semi-related lines of business to focus exclusively on the email deliverability and reputation business. They also acquired Habeas, their largest competitor in the deliverability business. In the process of doing these transactions, an opportunity presented itself to bring a new investor into the company, and Union Square Ventures was very pleased to be asked to be that new investor.  You can read CEO Matt Blumberg's blog post about the transformation of the business here.  Those that follow our investment activity closely will notice that this is a ""later stage"" investment, something that we are not known for doing. Brad mentioned in the post announcing our new fund that we would selectively look for late stage investments that operate in markets we know well and find attractive.  This is the second such investment and certainly not the last.   We are very happy to be an investor in Return Path, joining Flatiron Partners and our good friends Sutter Hill and Mobius. And we are thrilled to be able to back a terrific management team led by Matt, Jack Sinclair, and George Bilbrey. We look forward to creating the next big reputation based business on the Internet."
Boxee,fredwilson,2008-11-17 18:26:17,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"One of the big ""aha moments"" for me in the past couple years came when I hooked up a Mac Mini to a large display in our family room in the spring of 2007. Slowly but surely, our family started using the Mac Mini instead of the cable set-top box and the DVD player. My son watches YouTube videos on the Mac Mini, my daughter downloads tv shows and movies from iTunes and watches them on the Mac Mini. The Gotham Gal and I watch SNL on sunday morning on Hulu (that's Tina Fey on SNL being delivered into our family room via Hulu in the picture on the right). We also listen to music on iTunes and via streaming services like last.fm, Hype Machine, and, of course, fredwilson.fm on the Mac Mini. And when we are not actively engaged with it, the Mac Mini goes into screen saver mode and runs family photos that are sitting on a file server in our basement.  Not only are we watching less cable, we are watching less DVDs. We can get full length movies via Netflix, Hulu, and bittorrent on the Mac Mini. Many think that streaming video is not ready for ""prime time"" on a big screen in a family room but I can tell you definitively that is not true. We usually opt for streaming over file-based video due to the convenience, and the quality is fine.  All of this happens because the Mac Mini has a great HDMI interface, because it's small, compact, and doesn't make noise, and because the browser is increasingly becoming the interface to high quality audio and video services.  But there are some issues with using a Mac Mini in this way. First, the Mac Mini's Front Row interface isn't so great. We end up using the browser for most of our activities on the Mac Mini. And you need a wireless keyboard to interact with the web browser. That's OK, but not ideal for a family room/living room experience. And the browser interface doesn't have a simple integration point for all of the various video services we use.  We could use an Apple TV or a Media Center PC instead of an Mac Mini. But both Apple TV and Media Center are closed services, and you can't get to every piece of content you want to access with them. The open environment of a personal computer and a broswer is superior to both. I've always thought there was room for the ""Firefox of media center software."" The best candidate to be the Mozilla of this analogy is the powerful open-source XBMC project that has gathered quite a following among geeks since it started in 2002. So when I heard about a company called Boxee that was developing a commercial version of XBMC, I got excited.  I first met the founders of Boxee over a year ago. At the time they were considering building a hardware device to run the XBMC/Boxee software. I really liked what they were doing, but the idea of investing in hardware for the family room/living room scared me. I gave them a bunch of feedback and wished them well. Like most entrepreneurs, they didn't take no for an answer. And I've met with them on and off ever since. The big moment came this spring when I got boxee running on our Mac Mini on our family room. For the first time, we had a single interface built for a family room remote into all of our video, music, and photo libraries and web services. My daughter saw it and said ""genius."" That's a big compliment coming from her. But even so, I wasn't sold. Just because our family liked it doesn't mean there's a market for it. So I told Avner no once more.  In late September, Avner emailed me and told me that over 10,000 people had downloaded boxee for the Mac already and that someone in the open source community had built an Apple TV version. That was the market validation we were looking for. So we decided to get involved. Today Boxee is announcing that it has raised its first venture capital round co-led by Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital. I will be joining Boxee's board and will be joined by my good friend Bijan Sabet, a veteran of the ""web TV"" sector who spent time at both Web TV and Moxi Digital.  I believe Boxee will be the ""Firefox of media center software"". It's simple to download and install, it's available on Mac, Linux, and Apple TV. It will soon be available on Windows. And over 100,000 users have signed up to use it, and over 50,000 people are now registered users. And that's for a service that's still in a closed alpha. All you have to do is look at the Twitter talk about boxee to see how excited and engaged the user base is. If you'd like to give it a try, signup here. I'll end with a video showing what I'm talking about. I hope you join me on Boxee soon. Please let me know if you'd like an invite and I'll send you one. I'll need your email address to do so.    "
AMEE,albertwenger,2008-12-10 16:26:55,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"As anybody who has looked into dieting or just improving their nutrition knows, there is a lot of conflicting advice on the impact of fats and carbohydrates on your body.  But no matter what you ultimately conclude, you are now in the good position that you can select your food accordingly.  This has become possible because in the US (and many other countries), food is labeled with fairly detailed nutritional information, even meals at restaurants.  The same, however, is not yet true for making product purchasing choices based on environmental impact.  While some eco or green labels have started to emerge (e.g., EnergyStar in the US), we generally don't have the information available that would allow us to act on whatever our environmental convictions may be. There are many dimensions to the possible environmental impact of a product, such as whether the materials it is made from have been or can be recycled.  Another important aspect that a lot of people care about are the emissions that a product caused during its manufacturing process and will cause during its operation.  That turns out to be a much harder measurement problem to solve than the materials problem.  Consider a new computer.  When the computer runs, it consumes electricity.  The emissions caused by operating the computer therefore depend not just on how much you use it but also where your electricity comes from.  Then there are the emissions that were caused by getting the computer shipped to you.  That introduces more difficulty.  How far did the computer travel?  Was it shipped by truck the entire way or part of the way by air?  What kind of truck was it?  What type of airplane?  But if you crack open the computer, then it really gets tricky.  Every part that goes into the computer has its own emissions history.  It too was manufactured and then transported to get to the place that assembles the computer.  Determining emissions is thus a massive undertaking of connecting activities with their emission factors (which may well vary even for the same activity depending where or when it is carried out).  It is at this point that most people just give up and declare this problem as intractable.  The team at AMEE, instead saw an opportunity for a lightweight web service.  AMEE is a database in the cloud that allows tracking of activities and applying emission factors data to the tracked activities.  It was built from day one to support other applications and web sites which gather the activity data from consumers and businesses.  For consumers, that includes carbon calculators, e.g. Google UK's Carbon Footprint Project, but also services such as DOPPLR which uses AMEE to automatically calculate emissions for any trip it tracks.  For businesses, existing systems that can plug into AMEE include accounting and supply chain applications.  The beauty of the AMEE approach is that instead of trying to solve the entire measurement problem in one go, AMEE starts with a known level of detail even if at that level of detail only estimated emissions factors are available.  For instance, AMEE might have an estimate of the energy embedded in computer based on weight and materials.  AMEE might also have an estimate of the laptop's power consumption based on average usage.  And so on.  As more and more systems connect to AMEE and provide data, those initial estimates can be refined and triangulated.    As Tim O'Reilly has described in his ""Web Meets World"" theme, we are on a path to increasingly instrument the world.  Every time a new measurement system comes online, whether it is smart meters in homes, or cars that talk to the network, the data can be fed into AMEE allowing for a gradual transition from estimated emissions to detailed actual measurement of emissions.  AMEE has made the deliberate choice to focus only on acting as a backend database and web service so as to not compete with any of the systems and companies that could provide inputs for AMEE and thus help improve the quality of  AMEE's data asset.  All of this information will in turn let consumers and businesses make purchasing and production decisions that take environmental impact into account.   We firmly believe that making more information available will ultimately result in better decisions and that the Web is the perfect mechanism for empowering people to do so.  We are therefore excited to be investing in AMEE together with O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures and TAG and look forward to working with Gavin Starks and the AMEE team."
Arguing From First Principles,BradUSV,2009-01-28 11:46:19,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"David Swensen, the guy who manages Yale University's $19 billion endowment was asked the other night by Charlie Rose if there was anything he learned in school that informed his investment strategy today. David replied that he learned to argue from first principles. This struck me first as a great endorsement of the value of a liberal arts education, but it also seems to me to be a great foundation for an investment strategy.
 
We are often asked if our strategy is to invest in specific markets, like media, or financial services, or specific technologies, like video, or wireless, or if we confine ourselves to one style or stage of investing, or if we invest only in consumer facing businesses. If you looked at our portfolio you could conclude that we invest in early stage, consumer facing, web services, in the media market. I am sure we are guilty of furthering this misconception by using this description of our firm as a short hand when we introduce ourselves.  But it would not be true to say that our investment strategy is to invest in one stage, one type of business, one technology and one market.  That would not answer the question - why do we invest in these things? It would not be arguing from first principles.   So why do we invest this way?  We believe the web is fundamentally transformative (have we said this before). The global economy is defined by scarcity in resources, production, and distribution. On the web, the raw material is data. It is often shaped (produced) by volunteers, and it costs almost nothing to replicate and distribute the resulting product.  This is profoundly different than the current industrial economy. Our investment strategy is to arbitrage the difference between the capabilities of the new medium and readiness of the existing economic and social structures to exploit those capabilities.  Looked at that way, our apparent focus on early stage, consumer facing, web services in media markets makes a lot of sense. We invest at an early stage because many of the most important new business created on the web are phenomenally capital efficient, and we are concerned that the best businesses may have too much pricing power once they are well established and it may be difficult to invest at attractive prices. That said, we have invested in later stage businesses, which we believe will transform markets, and will continue to do so.   The apparent bias for consumer facing services has everything to do with the pace of adoption.  In enterprise markets, there are usually gatekeepers who have a vested interest in the current market structure. The best internet based businesses radically restructure markets. Where would Craigslist be today, if it had chosen to market classified advertising services to the newspaper industry.  Would we invest in an enterprise focused business? Absolutely - but only if they exploited the ""magic powers"" of the web to restructure an important market and had a way to circumvent the gatekeepers to get their service to market. Will it happen? Yes. Has it happened yet? Not often.   Is our apparent focus on web services a technology specialization, like semiconductors, or internet video? No. We invest in services that engage users. We are often approached by companies with a technology that serves pages faster, or that enables video to be streamed to cell phones over current networks, or some other incremental improvement.  We think it is critical for a web services start up to have in house technologists. We believe that technological innovation is often the key to attracting users early on. But we do not invest in the technology itself, because we believe technology differentiation is increasingly difficult to sustain. The technologists we do back are seldom doing basic electrical engineering. More often, they are user experience gurus and/or quants who can derive useful insights out of the flood of data that is a byproduct of users interacting with their service.  That brings us to media. Many people think of us as media investors. We're not. But it should be no surprise that we have made a lot of investments in and around media. It makes perfect sense that information markets will be the first to be disrupted by the web, but media is not the only market where services can be delivered as bits over the web. Banking, education, healthcare, and government will also be fundamentally changed.  Media has fallen first because it is consumer facing and there are fewer gatekeepers to slow the adoption of a more efficient delivery model.   So yes, today we are investing in early stage, consumer facing, web services, in the media market, but tomorrow we could be investing in a later stage, enterprise oriented, platform, in the healthcare market and it would be entirely consistent with our investment strategy

Twitter Fills The Tank,fredwilson,2009-02-13 17:02:33,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"This is hardly news since it leaked almost a month ago. Today our portfolio company Twitter announced that it has raised $35mm from two west coast venture capital firms, Benchmark and IVP. Union Square Ventures will also invest to maintain our ownership position, as will Spark Capital and several other investors.Biz has the news on the Twitter blog.There's not much else to say other than I am thrilled that Twitter will be working with Todd Chafee and his partners at IVP and Peter Fenton and his partners at Benchmark. The list of investors in Twitter just keeps getting better and better.I'd also like to address one question I've read in a lot of comment threads regarding the recent twitter financing rumors - why raise money now?. Twitter has a very small team and has a fairly small burn rate given the scale of the service it operates and its growth rate. The money Twitter raised last year would have and could have kept the company operating for quite a while. But there's a saying that I heard early on in my tenure in the venture business that still rings true.The best time to raise money is when you don't need it That's what Twitter did. I think it's a smart move and I am particularly pleased that we've added two very smart and seasoned venture capital firms to the mix.

Welcome Back Dave,BradUSV,2009-03-05 08:39:35,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"There is an old and perhaps slightly shopworn saying in the venture business that you back the jockey and not the horse. But in markets undergoing dramatic transformation, where there is a real advantage to being quick on your feet, it is as true as ever. Dave Morgan, who founded Real Media and then TACODA,  is one of the best ""jockeys"" we've worked with. Dave has a demonstrated ability to identify great market opportunities,attract world class talent, and build valuable businesses.   With his new venture Simulmedia, Dave is bringing the analytic and targeting techniques that he had pioneered on the internet to the world of linear television. Linear television is an enormous and (surprisingly) still growing business, but it is facing real challenges. Programming choices have exploded on television and audiences are increasingly spending time elsewhere, especially on the web. The developers and distributors of television programing spend enormous amounts of money to attract audiences to their shows. Today, much of that investment is wasted.   The insight that became the foundation for Simulmedia is that the Television industry is increasingly aware of the power of targeted promotions and that the aggregate, anonymous data needed to enable television programmers to target their promotions was now available.  We look forward to working again with Dave and his team and expect to have more to say about Simulmedia as they bring their services to the market in the next few months.     "

Open Spectrum is Good Policy,BradUSV,2009-04-03 10:03:03,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Fred wrote a post earlier this week advocating for more ""open spectrum"". Fred argues in his post that freeing up more open spectrum will have a much larger impact than spending $7.2B in stimulus money to run wires to rural constituents. He also references our friend Tom Evslin who has been thinking and writing about telecom policy for 30 years. I'd like to flesh out the argument here and at the risk of coming off as a total fanboy, link to a couple of Tom's other posts here and here on the subject of spectrum policy.  The first question to ask about spectrum policy is ""are we using spectrum efficiently today?"" The answer is no. Google makes this argument in their May 21, 2007 letter to the FCC asking for a clarification of the service rules governing the 700MHz band.   ""the vast majority of viable spectrum in this country simply goes unused, or else is grossly underutilized. Our nation typically uses only about five percent of one of our most precious resources.""   This study done with the National Science Foundation (warning 20meg download) supports the first part of Google's contention. It chronicles spectrum usage in New York City during the Republican National Convention. It shows that in the largest city in the country at what should theoretically be one of its busiest moments, we use a tiny fraction of the available spectrum.   So we only use a small portion of the available spectrum under the current policies. The second question is ""could the spectrum in use today be used more efficiently?"" The answer there is yes.  In there letter to the FCC Google goes on to say...  ""even that minimal use is inefficient compared to what is technically possible today.""  I have been working in and around telecom for a long time and I am slightly embarrassed to admit that I did not understand how obvious our underutilization of spectrum is until a few weeks ago when I was rummaging around in some of Tom's old posts.  Over simplifying slightly, the current allocation of spectrum is a lot like circuit switching. Open spectrum operates more like packet switching which is phenomenally more efficient at the cost of some complexity.  When I make a phone call to my dad in Florida over a circuit switched network, I tie up a continuous electrical circuit from New York to Vero Beach. When I send him an email, that note is chopped up in to packets and put out on the net intermingled with lots of other packets.   Circuit switching is simple but very extravagant in its use of resources. Packet switching is more chaotic. It has to deal with the possibility that two packets will arrive at the same place and the same time. But it is much more efficient. This is, by the way, why in times of crisis, when there is a huge surge in demand such as right after the attacks on 9/11, the phone networks don't work but email gets through.   Before you all jump down my throat, I know this analogy is an oversimplification. Telcos use packet switching in the backbone to multiplex lots of phone calls over fewer circuits, so one could argue that the profit motive of the Telcos naturally leads to an efficient use of circuits. An argument could also be made that the cellular carriers are using a related technique to get many conversations into the same spectrum by deploying lots of towers broadcasting at low power and switching users from cell to cell as they travel.  But we should not be surprised if the increase in the efficiency of licensed spectrum is less than we, as consumers, would like.  Anytime a vendor is granted a monopoly by the government, we should expect that vendor to manage their monopoly to maximize profits. When we license spectrum to mobile carriers, or TV networks, we are granting (or selling) them a monopoly over the management and use of a shared social resource. It is like giving the major oil companies an exclusive license to all of the oil in the US and expecting them to aggressively invest to increase the efficiency of extraction to drive down the price of gas at the pumps. The much more likely commercial reaction would be to extract slowly and manage the availability of the resource to keep the price and their profits high.  So, I for one am convinced that we do not use spectrum efficiently. Only a small portion of this important resource is in active use at any one time, and even when it is in use, most applications tie up a lot more spectrum than they need.  I suspect that an analysis of currently available unlicensed spectrum would show that those frequencies are used more efficiently than most licensed spectrum. I have not seen research on this so if anyone can point me to some, I'd be grateful.  But, efficiency may not even be the most important reason to open up more spectrum. As a society we benefit from technical innovation, and the pace of that innovation is much greater in unlicensed spectrum. This chart that I also found on Tom's blog comes from a comment submitted to the FCC proposing more unlicensed operation in the TV broadcast bands (white space) by a coalition of consumer advocates, wireless operators, and media watchdogs.       It is based on a very simple publicly available data set - the number of devices approved by the FCC for operation in licensed vs unlicensed spectrum. This does not speak directly to the value to consumers of all these devices, but if you assume the market works and that developers only invest in devices that they believe will ultimately get bought by consumers, it should be a pretty good proxy, and it tells a very important story.   It is a story that also seems to be playing out in other markets. When Apple introduced the iPhone, it had enough market clout to get AT&T to allow it to create a market for applications that AT&T would not control. The iPhone app store now has over 28,000 applications. I suspect that that is an order of magnitude more than have ever been approved by carriers. Again, I would love to see research that supported or refuted this point. The number of applications in the iPhone applications store is broadly available, can anyone point me to research on the total number of applications approved by wireless carriers to run ""on deck"" on their platforms? A cynic might argue that most iPhone apps are toys, but the number of applications downloads suggests that consumers like them and even the toys point the way to really valuable innovation like hundreds of different ways of using the accelerometer, or using the headset jack as an I/O channel.  I have heard a couple of reasonable arguments against increasing the amount of open spectrum. The first is that the government needs to grant a limited monopoly in spectrum in order to create an incentive for an operator to invest in the network that will operate in that spectrum. I am not an economist but I do know the cost of network infrastructure is coming down fast, and I suspect that it may already be low enough that network operators can create business plans that are attractive to private capital. More intriguing is the possibility that networks could be built in open spectrum as a series of interconnected networks like the Internet. This would radically reduce the capital requirements for any single network node, and likely lead to the creation of very efficient network back bones just as we have seen happen with the Internet.  A more subtle version of this argument is that a government granted monopoly creates the profits that fund the research and development spending needed to increase the efficiency of spectrum use. Advocates of licensed spectrum will likely point to the absolute size of their investment in R&D and argue that they will not be able to do that unless they have a monopoly that generates the profits needed to support that R&D. The problem with that argument is that there is no evidence that that R&D is creating real consumer benefit, and there is at least anecdotal evidence (I spent my early career poking around Bell Laboratories) that large, over-funded, research groups are an inefficient way to get innovation to market.  The second concern I have heard about opening up more unlicensed spectrum is that it invites the government into an important sector of the economy which they are very likely to screw up. I completely agree that we do not want the government to be involved in the day to day administration of this hugely important social resource. But enlightened spectrum policy can be the best kind of government regulation.The government seed funded ARPANET and in the process created the standards that enabled the creation of the Internet. I don't know if anyone has tried to measure the return on the government's initial investment in the Internet (again I'd love to see this analysis), but I suspect it may be the single most effective economic development program ever created. We have a rare opportunity to replicate that success with enlightened spectrum policy. If the FCC chooses to open up more spectrum and creates the right framework for managing competition for that scarce resource, and the Defense Department, or the National Science Foundation funds a few experimental networks to operate in that spectrum, I believe that we will see an explosion of innovation that rivals the impact of the Web.  Unfortunately, as Fred pointed out in his post, that is not where we are headed today. The $7.2B the administration has committed to broadband infrastructure appears to be headed for shovel ready projects by established telecom carriers to deploy outdated and inefficient technology that will perpetuate their market dominance and dampen innovation. This is the wrong kind of government intervention into the market. It is not that it is not well intentioned, and I am not qualified to talk about it's effectiveness as a stimulus, but it will not have nearly the lasting impact that it could have if it were targeted at disruptive innovation in open spectrum. Why? Because access to those dollars will be a highly politicized process that will result in the firms with the most access getting the most dollars. Those firms tend to be the incumbent telcos and cable companies who have an obligation to their shareholders to maximize their profits by defending their duopoly. They have no interest in more open spectrum that would create an incentive for private capital to finance wireless alternatives to the wires that they now control to the home.  If the administration were to create more open spectrum, they would be creating a vibrant market. They would actually be taking the politics out of the management of communications.  It may be tough in these times to walk away from potential revenue from the auction of spectrum, but the administration can have a much more profound and lasting impact on the quality of life of all Americans by opening up spectrum than they every could by putting stimulus dollars in the hands of the incumbent duopoly.

Hacking Education ,BradUSV,2009-05-08 16:22:13,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"It has been two months since we hosted a great group of academics, entrepreneurs, educators, and administrators at our Union Square Sessions Event, Hacking Education. Fred posted his initial thoughts immediately after the event and in a great example of peer production, Alex Krupp curated the Twitter stream that captured the thoughts of folks inside and outside of the event.  I finally found some quality time to spend with the transcript that is now online, and thought I would try to expand on Fred's initial thoughts and develop a couple of the key themes that came out of the conversation. Before diving in, however, I'd like to make a pitch for the transcript. It is not perfect (imagine trying to record 40 high powered people all talking at once), but it is readable and full of lots of insights. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the impact of technology on education to plow through it. I have tried to pull some of the highlights here, but there is no way that even this overlong post can do justice an energizing and enlightening afternoon.  There was broad consensus that the internet is enabling substantial changes in the way we learn and teach. It has always been possible to learn outside of a school setting. The ubiquitous connectivity and very low cost of content production and distribution seems to enable the unbundling of key components of education.   Dissagregation - David Wiley broke education into these components, 1) content provisioning, 2) research - conducted, archived, and disseminated, 3) help provided to a student with a question on the content, 4) a social life, and 5) issuing credentials.  Historically all of these components were bundled together in the experience of on-site education in a K-12 or University context. Already today, it is possible for a student to get many of these services outside the walls of a traditional educational institution. One of my favorite illustrations of all of this is a story recounted by Mimi Ito in her report - Living and Learning with New Media (pdf link)
  
In her study of anime music video (AMV) creators (Anime Fans), Mizuko Ito interviewed Gepetto, an 18-year-old Brazilian fan. He was first introduced to AMVs through a local friend and started messing around creating AMVs on his own. As his skills developed, however, he sought out the online community of AMV creators on animemusicvideos.org to sharpen his skills. Although he managed to interest a few of his local friends in AMV making, none of them took to it to the extent that he did. He relies heavily on the networked community of editors as sources of knowledge and expertise and as models to aspire to. In his local community, he is now known as a video expert by both his peers and adults. After seeing his AMV work, one of his high-school teachers asked him to teach a video workshop to younger students. He jokes that ""even though I know nothing,"" to his local community ""I am the Greater God of video edit¬ing."" In other words, his engagement with the online interest group helped develop his identity and competence as a video editor well beyond what is typical in his local community.    In theory, Gepetto could have learned video editing in school. In practice his school was not equipped to teach it. He found content, help, a social life, and even credentialing (as others linked to his work) on www.animemusicvideos.org.   
Rob Kalin kicked the discussion on the separation of learning and credentialing into high gear with this story.
  
I graduated high school with a D minus average. ...My guidance counselor said ""drop out of high school, you'll have an easier time getting into college if you just get a GED."" I [decided] to graduate with this D minus and see what it does for me. I didn't get into any accredited school . I got into a diploma program in an art school in Boston, and it was near MIT. ... I used the art school to make a fake ID to go to MIT. Someone said [college is] expensive. I said no, it's free, you just won't get credit for it.  
Today, no one is going to ask Rob for his college transcript. His credentials are the companies he has created.  Not every student can be so cavalier about the lack of a diploma, but the web is having an interesting impact on the value of credentials. In an earlier era, it was very difficult to evaluate a student's work directly, so a grade from an accredited institution served as a proxy. Now, if an employer wants to hire a video editor, Geppeto's work is on the web readily accessible.  Students in the future will be as likely to be evaluated on their portfolio of work, as they are on their grades. That's lucky for Geppeto because, as his story makes clear, there is no way his school was capable of evaluating his work.  Fred pushed the conversation about disaggregation to another level when he suggested that in the future, he'd like to see students be able to opt in or out of a school on a class by class basis.  When I think about where we are going to be in 50 years, I think we are going to have a marketplace model for education where the student is in control of their education and they determine who is going to educate them, when, where,  and how... I'd like my kids to be able to avail themselves of the quality classes and teachers they have in their physical space but then opt out of those [classes] that aren't good and go get that knowledge somewhere else.  
A byproduct of the disaggregation of education will be to weaken the authority of schools, but the bigger challenge may be to align their cost structures and business models to remain competitive in a hyper connected world.  Bing Gordon dropped a bombshell just before lunch when he proposed that we should work to drive the marginal cost of education to zero.
 
From an economic point of view, I would say the goal... is to figure out how to get education down to a marginal cost of zero. Somebody mentioned Oxford. I think the marginal cost for a student at Oxford is probably $250,000; at a U.S. university it's probably $90,000. That's what it costs per student. That's not what they charge. Public school, I think, they are trying to do it for $6-8000 per student. So, what if we had to get it to zero? We've seen technologies that get the marginal cost [of services] to zero, plus bandwidth.  This is not as crazy as it sounds. Knowledge is, as the economists say, a non-rival good. If I eat an apple, you cannot also eat that same apple; but if I learn something, there is no reason you cannot also learn that thing. Information goods lend themselves to being created, distributed and consumed on the web. It is not so different from music, or classified advertising, or news.  For Shai Reshef the idea of reducing the cost of education isn't just theoretical. He described University of the People this way.  It is a non-profit, tuition free, online university...students are not going to pay for courses or tuition. However, they pay admission and they pay for exams that they take after each course... The idea is open admission to everyone.  ...We use open source and open courseware... basically everything that is available for free... there are not going to be any teachers in the classroom. Students are going to teach each other...  ... [the discussions are] asynchronous... because of the time differences and there is not going to be any video... it's very, very simple [so] that anyone around the world can get it.  ... we teach only two courses, business and information technology... these are the most needed degrees to get a job.   It's not for everyone. You need to know English, you need to have a computer... our assumption [is that the students will be from] the upper end of the lower class or the lower end of the middle class... its people who almost made it... who could have been at the university but missed their chance.  
So by targeting a very specific audience, delivering only two courses, using open courseware and open source technology, asking students to teach other on a very simple platform, Shai hopes to be able to deliver a limited, but valuable education to an important segment of the global population for free. He will ask them to pay only for testing (accreditation).  Shai is not dropping the marginal cost of education to zero. But he has figured out how to deliver two courses at a marginal cost of pretty close to zero. His costs (and the price to students) is in accreditation. The marginal cost of Gepetto's self directed ""course"" in video editing was also zero plus bandwidth. He did not pay for accreditation. The only ""credit"" he got was the approval of his peers on the web site and the recognition of his teachers back at school.   I had a lunch conversation with David Wiley (it's not in the transcript) about whether or not it would ever be possible to reduce the cost of accreditation to zero. I was stuck on the problem of grading papers. I understood how a computer could grade a math exam, but how could you grade an essay on Aristotle. The best I could imagine was that underpaid, but still costly, teaching assistants grade the student's essays. David said, ""oh that's easy"". You agree with the students on a set of criteria for how the essays are going to be graded and then have each student read a few essays. The readers critique can then also be read by a couple of students and the students final grade is based on how well they wrote and how well they critiqued according to a jury of their peers. By having every essay and every critique reviewed by multiple people, you eliminate the outliers and arrive at a fair grade. So at least in theory, it is possible to peer produce the critique something of as abstract as an essay on Aristotle.  The possibility that education can be unbundled, and that, as an information good, it may be possible to radically reduce the cost of providing at least some types of education could have important social consequences. We spent a good portion of the afternoon talking about some of those issues and some creative ways to use technology to address the issues that technology is creating.  As the web becomes more central to learning, bridging the digital divide becomes more critical. The webs resources are only available to someone with a computer. That sounds simple but as Danielle Allen points out, it's not.  A small anecdote on the issue of technology in schools to underscore the fact that any conversation on education needs to take a whole bunch of other factors into account, which are pretty absent from our conversation. I've served on the board of the University of Chicago Charter School for a number of years. We had to quit handing out laptops because kids were getting attacked. First, we tried school buses so they did not have to walk home, but that wasn't enough, and it's super expensive. So, it wasn't a sustainable program, just because of various social factors.  The difference between those who have computers and those who do not is important but there was also a lot of conversation about those who do not have the cultural background that would lead them to take advantage of the learning opportunities on the web.  dana boyd reminded us that ""technology does not determine practice""  Just shoving broadband into a group of kids, just giving them an iPhone, we can think of a gazillion designs that are valuable ... but, if you don't have a culture embedded in it, [it] becomes just another toy you can text your friends with... I've become so infinitely frustrated with... ""let's just dump a bunch of  laptops into a population and see what they do with it""... That doesn't work... We've watched students rip out the batteries and use them for everything else under the sun.... I don't think we can just think about the technology.... We have to think about it in a broader system.  Even if you solve the real world problems Danielle cites, and embed the technology into a framework that enables meaningful learning, students will still fall into two groups, those that were lucky enough to have been raised in a cultural context that values learning and those that who were not. The story of Gepetto suggests that someone with access to a computer and a desire to learn can learn a lot on the web. What about that portion of the student population that is not self motivated? How can we reach them?  Jon Bischke reminded us of the William Butler Yeats quote ""Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire"".  Several people suggested that this is the role of a great teacher. Steven Johnson described how he learned a passion for baseball and suggested that game mechanics may be one way to light a fire when a great teacher is un available or unaffordable.  
When I think about the skills that... I got when I was a young kid that are still valuable, I think back to when I was 10 or 11 when I spent thousands of hours playing baseball games and designing better baseball games. I got a huge amount out of that in terms of the math involved in creating the whole statistical model of how baseball works and stats, and a lot of collateral learning experience...  But the most important thing about that was, I learned how to be obsessed with things... I got obsessed with these things and I had a series of stages in my life where I got obsesses with something else. And I just immersed myself to learn as much as I could. And it's that mechanism I used again and again and again in my professional life. So how do you teach kids to be obsessed with things? 
I think one of the advantages we have with technology and particularly with games is that they have a built in structure, almost to a fault, as most parents would say. They have an addictive quality where people will just immerse themselves and become obsessed with them...When you look at the games that most of these kids are playing, the amount of information that they have to accumulate and master to perform well in these games is massive compared to the amount of information they are willing to learn at school... there is something in this kind of platform. Without anyone telling them to do it, they are going out, learning all this information, and becoming really skilled at it.  Katie Salen has spent the last two years trying to tackle all of these problems at once. She has created a New York City public school that will open in the fall that is based on the idea of game based learning.  We wanted to open a public school because we are really interested in the equity and access question.  Like Dana, Katie understands the importance of context and culture.  In order to actually have transformative change, you needed to work at a systemic level. So the idea was to design a school from the ground up. All aspects of the school, the curriculum, the professional development program, student recruitment, the kinds of technology and communications platforms in the school, the leadership model - all of that is built around a pedagogy, which is the way we think kids learn best.  And it's based on game dynamics.

In a lot of our work we found that kids that have struggled in traditional schools do really well with some of the work we have been doing around game-based learning.  As encouraging as Katie's story is, there was also some real concern about the future of education. Fred put it this way:  the problem is that the whole economics of that physical space breaks down as [students] opt out [of parts of traditional campus based education]. Maybe this is just what we're going through in other industries... that they get crushed by the organizing efficiencies of the Internet. But I don't know how to get across that chasm  Fred is suggesting that the education industry may soon face the same challenges that currently confront the music industry and the newspaper industry. Like those industries, education can be peer produced, delivered as bits, and curated by a community. Like the music and newspaper industries, the cost structures embedded in the education industry's current business models may be very difficult to support in the face of competition from hyper-efficient, web native businesses.   Unlike the music and newspaper businesses, education plays several roles in current society.  Diana Rhoten pointed out that:  School is a safe place for a lot of kids. It's not only the single parent argument. But, it's also that school represents the eight hours of your day when you are actually warm and have food. Not every kid can opt out of that.  Katie Salen picked up on that:  In the early part of the [last] century there was this configuration between home, church, and school. And it was understood that kids learned in those three different places and it was really clear what was learned in those three places. And over time.... all of it got stuck back in the school.  The day was characterized by this conflict between the technologists and entrepreneurs who were driven by the conviction that we can use what Tim O'Reilly calls the ""magic powers"" of the web to drive down the cost of learning and increase access to knowledge. This optimistic view was tempered by the concern that education is not music and that the existing structure of education delivers a lot more that knowledge. If the transition from the current high touch, but high cost, learning environment to an efficient peer produced learning network is as abrupt and brutal as the transition we are witnessing in the music and newspaper industry, the social consequences are likely to be a lot more severe.  Early in the day Bob Kerrey's reminded us that education is not like other industries, that it has always, at least in the U.S., always been tied up in our notions of citizenship, and that the collective decisions we make about education have always been politicized.   It is worth remembering that the history of the common school in the United States is a history of people attempting to pass state laws mandating education at an early age, mandating the creation of public schools.  And up until the 1920s, when there began to be the a rise of the nativist movement, as a result of the enactment of the openly racist Immigration Act of 1924 and the creation of the American Legion, that resulted in the rapid expansion of public schools in the United States of America for the purpose of teaching citizenship. That's why the Pledge of Allegiance is mandated in all schools.  If one of your 11-year-olds is found out on the streets of Atlanta this afternoon, they can be arrested and found in the juvenile justice system for violating their -- as an offender of their status.  They're required, for approximately a thousand hours a year in all 50 states, to be in schools.  So, that's the context.  Secondly, you've got to sort of imagine yourself -- I have a 7-year-old in the largest public school district in the country, the New York public school system.  If you're trying to have an impact on PS41 where he goes to school, to put it mildly, that's a hell of a challenge.  Just to try to have an impact upon the arrival of air-conditioners in June, let alone the curriculum and the budget and other sorts of things.  So, I think you have to separate the conversation between the effort to improve the public schools and the effort to improve the non-public school environment.  These are two completely different things.   
And finally, you have to get used to the idea that you have to bring an argument inside the context -- you haven't been in a room full of parents.  There are 2 million parents in the New York public school system that might, I should say, have a slightly different attitude about what they want the New York public school system to accomplish than I do.  And these board meetings can be raucous, dispiriting and at times counterproductive.  You find yourself saying, Gee, I don't want to do that anymore.  You can find yourself fighting the battle to get curriculum imposed and brought to the schools and it's exactly what you wanted and, two years later, the board of election occurs and the people you supported get turned out.  So in the end, the technologist's enthusiasm for radically reinventing education was tempered by an increased awareness of the broader social role that our educational institutions play and a greater appreciation for the political will needed to bring the full benefits of the web to public schools. The academics and educators heard about a number of interesting experiments that use peer production, game dynamics, super distribution, and the ubiquitous connectivity of the web to create meaningful demonstrations of what can be done. The challenge for all of us it to find ways to exploit technology to reduce the cost and increase the accessibility of education; build political support for the structural changes needed to make this a reality in public schools and architect a transition from the current industrial model of education to a network based model while minimizing social dislocation.

Heyzap,albertwenger,2009-05-26 10:26:06,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Online casual games are a large and rapidly growing form of entertainment.  According to Comscore over 85 million people play casual games every month in the US alone and minutes spent playing grew a staggering 42% from 2008 to 2009.    Casual games originated as downloadable PC games. Based mostly on free trials with payment for full play, the industry grew to over $1 billion (published numbers vary widely and some estimates are significantly higher).  The move to online has come with a fairly pronounced decline in the price for downloadable games.  One of the reasons for this price decline of downloadable games is that simple online casual games are easier to develop than downloadable games.   The low threshold for creating a playable game is also reflected by the incredible fragmentation of the market:  with over 20,000 online casual games, the average number of games produced by an individual developer is around 3.    One might argue that this fragmentation has not been an issue for people looking to play casual games, as there are many portal sites, such as Miniclip and Big Fish Games, which aggregate thousands of games.  But for someone to go to a portal site requires a conscious decision to play games.  Yet many online casual games can be played in increments of only a few minutes, which means that ""impulse play"" is possible.  Impulse playing occurs when someone comes across a game in an unexpected place and decides to try it out.  For instance, games might appear in a sidebar next to content or someone might end a blog post by including a game.  Deeper integration with content would also provide an opportunity for ""habitual play.""  This is what happens today with newspaper puzzles like Sudoku and KenKen.  Readers read whatever they are interested in and then turn to the puzzle as a habit (some of course turn to the puzzle first).  Similar habitual behavior exists for the funnies.  Puzzles and funnies serve an important function of providing a kind of comic relief / distraction from the generally mostly bad news.  Online, casual games can serve a similar function.  To make these modes of gameplay more widely accessible requires making it super easy for publishers to add games to their existing content.  We are excited to be backing a team out of Y-combinator doing just that.  Jude Gomila and Immad Akhund launched Heyzap in January 2009 and are working hard to let all kinds of publishers -- from individual bloggers to large sites -- add games as readily and with as much control over content as videos.  Heyzap already offers plugins for Wordpress and Blogger, several different size widgets, RSS feeds of games and an API for programmatic control, all of which let publishers with just a few clicks select games that best match their audience or personal interests.   Many more features are on the way.  We look forward to discovering new games in unexpected places and enjoying our favorites with our daily dose of tech news."
Bring the world to your event,EricFriedman,2009-06-15 10:45:06,1,0,[u'EricFriedman'],"Union Square Ventures hosted an event called Hacking Education that sparked conversations far beyond the day of the event, and did so in a way where we gave up control of the conversation and allowed it to spread.  Steven Johnson recently wrote his thoughts about how Twitter will change the way we live, and within that article explained the process by which we shared our small event with anyone who was interested, and explained its impact:  Injecting Twitter into that conversation fundamentally changed the rules of engagement. It added a second layer of discussion and brought a wider audience into what would have been a private exchange. And it gave the event an afterlife on the Web. Yes, it was built entirely out of 140-character messages, but the sum total of those tweets added up to something truly substantive, like a suspension bridge made of pebbles.  I wanted to take the time to explain exactly how that was done and some of the thinking around it.  Leading up to the event we debated internally about what to project up on the screen.  Albert was going to curate the conversation throughout the day and had a few visual references and videos that he wanted to show, but a question remained of what to put up the rest of the time.  The day before the event we settled on a Twitter search stream hoping that our audience would contribute to this ""back channel"".  Not everyone is willing to jump into a conversation, especially in front of a large group - and this provided an easy way to react, agree or even disagree with someone simply by sending a message for all to see.  Early in the morning we put up a message explaining that any update using the hash tag ""#hackedu"" would appear on screen.  The first few tweets trickled in, mostly recapping great points, or synthesizing great thoughts for the outside world to see.  Soon questions and retorts began to appear on screen, but none broke the flow of conversation.  As Stephen alluded to in his article, many folks from outside the room were following, answering back, and participating in the room as their messages were being seen by all participants.  Below is example of how it looked
From our Hacking Education photoset  To get this accomplished we setup a laptop connected to a projector and broadcast the standard search.twitter.com page with one slight adjustment.  The standard search page does not update in real time and rather then clicking ""refresh"" every few minutes we needed to find a real time solution.  Thankfully, someone had already created this solution in the form of a greasemonkey Firefox script.  After loading up the page, confirming the auto-refresh was in place, we simply began sending the hash tag #hackedu into the system and the rest is now online forever.  Steps to setup real time Twitter conversations to your event:  1. Agree on a hash tag to use for the duration of the event (in our case #hackedu was short, descriptive, and easy to remember)
2. Have a laptop with an Internet connection projecting onto a wall or screen
3. Use Firefox and install the add-on called greasemonkey
4. Once greasemonkey is installed grab the Twitter search auto refresh script (or something similar)   
You can continue to see and even join the conversation today simply by searching for #hackedu"
The Mobile Challenge,usv,2009-06-25 18:34:19,1,0,[u'usv'],"We are fascinated by the disruption underway in mobile applications. Carriers seem to have lost their role as gatekeepers for applications as smartphone sales are rapidly ramping and ""app stores"" or direct downloads are the new distribution models. This is exciting as it opens up a whole new arena for startups to compete in. Here is some of our early thinking about this with the goal of getting a discussion going.   The challenge for startups (and investors!) has been identifying opportunities that are ""native"" to the new platforms. By ""native"" we mean opportunities that simply did not exist previously and cannot exist without the phone. For instance, we would not consider delivering breaking news to a mobile a native opportunity, as a startup rarely has a better chance of being ""CNN for mobile"" than CNN does.  Native opportunities are the ones that make use of unique capabilities of mobile platforms. Here is a starter list of such capabilities:  * Location. To be precise this should really say ""high resolution and continuous location"" because computers too have location, but IP geo-lookup is a lot coarser grained, less reliable and most importantly not available when the user is not at their computer.   * Proximity. This could simply be thought of as location, but it is likely to be so important that it deserves its own mention. Knowing the location of a user makes it possible to determine not just where that user is in relation to stores, landmarks, etc. but also to other users.  * Touch. Not all smartphones have touch screens (most Blackberries don't), but touch is an important and (almost) unique capability.   * Audio input. This may not seem like a big one, but the fact that all phones have it (hard to be a phone otherwise) makes it unique. Building a desktop app or web app that relies on audio input is a bit more challenging.  * Video input. Sure you can attach a camera to a PC (and most Macs have one built-in), but that camera is never where the user needs it, except for video chat. Also you can take an image with your regular camera and import it into the computer but that adds at least three steps which will result in a huge drop-off rate and prevent any immediacy. So having video input that is always and conveniently available is a unique capability.  Something that is noticeably absent from the list of unique capabilities is (data) connectivity. This is new for phones, but it has always existed on the web, so it is unlikely to provide an opening for startups. For instance, wanting to be a streaming music service for mobile won't easily give a startup a leg up on existing streaming services.  Each of these unique capabilities, taken individually, is not novel. For example, Palm devices brought touch to consumers in the 90s and location has been available on standalone GPS devices for decades. But the convergence of all of these features on a single device with access to an internet connection will allow new behaviors and applications to emerge that were not previously possible on any other platform. The potential emergence of new behaviors is likely to be as important -- if not more so -- than these technical capabilities themselves. After all, there were no large changes in technology that allowed Facebook to take off; rather it was a social shift in personal information sharing. We don't know which native applications will emerge as ones that combine these unique capabilities and new behaviors into true breakout services, but here are some categories that we find interesting along with some of the challenges that they face:  * Location-based social networking, such as Loopt, Brightkite and foursquare. The big question in this category is whether these new networks will gain enough scale that they can compete effectively with the mobile offerings of existing social networks, or if the mobile networks differentiation in value proposition will be insufficient to overcome the current gap in scale.   * Gaming, such as Rolando and FieldRunners. As evidenced by reviewing the Top 25 apps at any given time, gaming has been one of the killer categories for the iphone. However, games played on mobile phones that don't leverage the unique capabilities are likely to be quickly dominated by the large existing publishers. For example, currently 7 of the top 25 best-selling paid games are major publisher releases. There would seem, however, to be an opening for a new type of gaming experience, such as mainstream versions of Alternate Reality Games (which using the phones might become ""Augmented Reality Games"").   * Shopping applications will likely be interesting and there has already been an early exit with SnapTell being acquired by Amazon. Most US-based mobile shopping applications simply supplement the real-world shopping experience with more information (barcode scan sending you to Google, BBB, Consumer Watch info, price comparison, etc...). This behavior contrasts with Asian markets where actual commerce/checkout via mobile is far more prevalent. We're interested in seeing if the unique capabilities of smartphones will accelerate mobile shopping all the way through checkout on the phone.  * Healthcare, such as Epocrates for practitioners and LoseIt for consumers. Healthcare practitioners and consumers are two key target audiences for mobile applications and their needs vary greatly. The practitioners are generally a lower scale and higher ARPU market whereas the consumers are a higher scale and lower ARPU market.  One notable absence from this set of categories is navigation. While this will clearly be an important category, we expect companies that have established the technology necessary to deliver navigation on previous custom devices to dominate on the phones as well. For example, the iPhone SDK license agreement disallows ""real time route guidance"" applications. There was speculation that this restriction was put in place because Apple wanted a major navigation company to tackle this problem first, and, subsequently, TomTom produced a great implementation at WWDC.  There is a good chance that the truly breakthrough application category is not on this list. It will be obvious in hindsight but a lot harder to anticipate. If you are working on a native application, please tell us about it."
Chris and Malcolm are both wrong,BradUSV,2009-08-09 13:16:42,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Many of you are familiar with dust up between Chris Anderson and Malcolm Gladwell that was touched off by Malcolm's review of Chris's new book, Free: The Future of Radical Price. [UPDATE: Free is no longer free. The link to Chris's book has been retired. You can find Chris's book on Amazon.]  Anderson's book points out that the cost of providing web services is declining as a result of open source software, commodity hardware, and cheap bandwidth. Gladwell agrees with the trend but notes that it is very expensive for YouTube to host video. Gladwell and Anderson also traded visions of the future of the media business, with Anderson arguing that content was becoming commoditized and Gladwell holding up the Wall Street Journal's paid web subscription as an example of paid for premium content. Ultimately the debate veered into a discussion of the economics of abundance, pitting overly enthusiastic cyber utopians against cynical and perhaps self interested, defenders of current media business models.   The debate was entertaining but not very satisfying. Malcolm's examples were too narrow and not compelling. The WSJ gets away with a subscription, for the moment, because their users bill it to their corporate credit card. YouTube has real costs because of its enormous scale, and the structure of the pharmaceutical industry has little to do with purely digital products on the web. Chris, on the other hand, drifts too easily into an imagined world of abundance where economics (for lack of scarcity) will no longer be able to describe human behavior.  I agree with Chris that the economics of the web are fundamentally different, but I agree with Malcolm that the basic laws of economics still apply. I understand why Chris and others are attracted to a ""new"" economics of abundance. Material abundance does change what we value, but it does not eliminate scarcity. Malcolm, Chris, Seth, and Fred all made good points in this debate. Many others weighed in. Much of this conversation is captured here in the Squidoo lense devoted to the topic.  My frustration with the debate about Free is that it seems like a last ditch effort to fit the internet economy into the familiar framework of the industrial economy. That isn't going to work. Free is not a pricing strategy, a marketing strategy, or the inevitable consequence of a market with low variable costs. It's a symptom of a much more fundamental economic shift.  Until we agree on what resources are scarce and have a framework for how they will be allocated in the future we are not just talking past each other, we are talking about the wrong things.   Fortunately, a bunch of smart people have been thinking about scarcity in an information economy for a long time. Herbert Simon, the Nobel winning economist and psychologist, first wrote about it in 1971.  ...in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.  Since then Michael Goldhaber and Rishab Gosh have debated the nature of the attention economy. John Hagel summarized the arguments here. These insights into the economy of attention offer a powerfully explanatory perspective in the debate about Free and explain why Free will be the dominant media model of the near future.   In a world where facts are readily available, from multiple sources, basic information will be commoditized. But the explosion of sources will create a real burden for the consumers of information.  Raw information will become not just a commodity, it will be a nuisance. In that world, consumers will value scarce, relevant insight over abundant facts.  Computer scientists have been working for years on algorithmic ways of mining text for insight with only modest success. It turns out that people still out perform computers at this task. Web services like Google,  LastFM, and Facebook, succeed because they do a good job of harnessing the explicit or implicit input of users to sift through an overwhelming supply of information to deliver relevant insight. Google uses in-bound links to filter search results.  LastFM uses other people with similar tastes to recommend music. Facebook filters information by the strength of relationships. So the users of these services are not just consumers, they are a necessary participant in the creation of the service. Since all these services require a large base of users for their filtering techniques work, you could just as easily ask why the services are not paying their producers. Debating whether to charge these same producers make little sense.  Both sides of the debate about Free do not seem to acknowledge how fundamentally different the relationship between suppliers and consumers is on the web. Services are not offered for free at all. There is an exchange of value between users, the creators of the raw material - data, content, and meta-data, and the network where that data is converted into insight. This exchange is still governed by the basic laws of economics but the currency is not dollars, it's attention.  The network that takes attention and converts it into insight is also quite different than a traditional firm. The services they provide are more like those we expect from a government than a company. Craigslist, Facebook, and Twitter all provide (or try to provide) a robust stable reliable infrastructure (hosting, bandwidth), security, safety, and dispute resolution. In all three cases, the product users create and consume emerges organically from this environment.  In a world where the scarce resource is some combination of time, attention, relevance and insight, those commodities become the medium of exchange in a parallel economy alongside traditional currencies, debating what a traditional firm charges for something they produce and distribute to customers who have no role in the product's creation sheds very little light on what is going on today.  The much more interesting conversation is about the appropriate economic model for a social network that depends on the contributions of its participants and increases in value as more people use it. One possibility is that the economic models of these networks will look more like Craigslist than Yahoo. Recent estimates peg Craigslist's revenue at more than $100,000,000. Not much compared to Yahoo's billions, but Craigslist still employs only 28 people. Even allowing for substantial bandwidth, and server costs, it is still hard to imagine how their costs are more than $5,000,000. Since Craigslist collapsed a multibillion dollar classified advertising business into a fabulously profitable $100,000,000 business, perhaps we should be talking about the potential deflationary impact of more ""zero billion dollar"" businesses. As the radical efficiencies of the web seep into more sectors of the economy, and participants in social networks exchange attention instead of dollars, will governments at all levels need to make do with less tax revenue? That's a scary thought in an era of high deficits unless traditional governments can learn from the efficent governance systems of social networks and provide more for less."
Foursquare,albertwenger,2009-09-01 12:37:30,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"We recently wrote about our search for native mobile applications, which we defined as applications that simply were not possible previously (as opposed to making something that already exists online accessible via mobile).  We have also long been interested in gameplay (Zynga and Heyzap) and in local information (outside.in).  We were therefore thrilled to find an opportunity that combines all three and are pleased to announce our investment in Foursquare.  Foursquare allows you to ""check in"" at a venue (via the iphone app, the mobile site, or SMS).  Your check in is broadcast to your friends, which is a great way to let them know where you are.  For most people, a conscious act of sharing is a lot less worrisome than an ongoing broadcast of location.  By checking in, you also participate in various levels of game play.  First, there are badges to unlock which provide a fun and unexpected reward for different types of behavior (like staying out late!).  Second, foursquare rewards loyalty to a venue and if you really go somewhere a lot you may become the ""mayor"" of that location.  In other words, checking in is both useful (signal) and fun (badges, mayorships).  Foursquare in turn uses check-ins to generate interesting local information.  Some of it is explicit, such as the ""shouts"" that people can add to a check-in or the tips that they can leave for friends.  A lot of it is implicit based on patterns of check-ins.  Foursquare is already making some of that information available through an API with some first applications already built, such as SocialGreat.  It is still early days, but as more people check in, Foursquare will generate more information, which in turn can be used to make future check ins more valuable.  There are many additional goodies coming soon, such as a native app for the Blackberry.  We look forward to working with the foursquare team -- Dennis Crowley, Naveen Selvadurai and Harry Heymann -- when we are not busy fighting for the Mayorship of Whichcraft!"
Introducing Tracked.com ,BradUSV,2009-10-21 09:31:26,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"At Union Square Ventures, we seldom invest in a company before it launches publicly. The exception is when we have the opportunity to back an experienced entrepreneur with a strong team and a strong product vision. That is exactly what happened with Tracked.com. So we now find ourselves in the unusual position of announcing the public launch of an investment we made some time ago.  A year ago, Mike Yavonditte, a web veteran based in New York who had worked at  Ziff-Davis, Juno, Alta Vista and Interactive Corporation, and who had most recently gone wire to wire as the CEO of Quigo, began assembling a team to build a new kind of financial information service.  We were impressed by how many of the people he had worked with at Quigo were either investors in the company or employees. That wasn't the case with one of his key hires, Bert Solivan from FoxNews, but he came on board after working with Mike as one of Quigo's largest customers.   Mike also brought a fresh perspective to financial information services; one that we believe could be the foundation for a fundamentally different user experience. Tracked.com has all of the usual data sources and features that you would expect from a financial information service, but they have acquired a number of sources that no one else is currently presenting, sources that allow them to provide unique insights into private as well as public companies. They deliver that rich data set through an interface that can be highly customized and adapts to the users behavior on the site. This idea, which Mike brought with him from the ad optimization world, was one of the things we found most intriguing about Tracked.com's product vision.   Just as you would expect from an ad optimization system, everything on the site is instrumented, but instead of using a user's behavior on the site to serve ads, Tracked.com uses it to continually improve the relevance of the content it presents.   Perhaps the most innovative thing Tracked.com has done is to introduce a social media layer to a financial services site.  Tracked.com is more than just an information service. The service is designed to allow you to share insights within the service, publicly or within a private group and will soon allow you to link out to all of the popular social media sites and embed charts and other content.  These are still early days. Tracked.com is still presenting only a small fraction of the data they have licensed on the site.  They expect to rapidly evolve the interface and the social features as users interact with the service. But based on our experience over the last few weeks, it is already an incredibly useful service. Check it out and let us know what you think."
Duolingo,BradUSV,2012-06-18 16:59:50,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Luis von Ahn is nothing if not ambitious. The inventor of the captcha and the founder of re-captcha has a new goal - to translate the web into every major language.  Because web users speak hundreds of different languages, and over 50% of it is now in English, the web remains inaccessible to a huge number of potential users.   For Luis's purposes machine translation is not good enough. Google translate will give you some sense of what is on a page but humans can still do a much better job. The difference is painfully obvious if you want to read a long blog post or an article from a foreign media site. The challenge Luis, Severin Hacker, and the rest of the team at Duolingo have set for themselves is how to get humans to translate the web. Their solution is to make translation the byproduct of something many humans around the globe are already doing - learning a new language. Because Duolingo produces something of economic value - translations - as a byproduct of the learning process, they can do something else that is really cool. They can offer a language learning service, that would otherwise sell for hundreds of dollars, for free. If you have ten minutes, watch Luis describe Duolingo in this TED talk.  We are thrilled today to announce our investment in Duolingo.  By making language learning accessible to a huge audience around the world that could never afford a traditional language course, they have unlocked a skill that is the key to economic opportunity.   I am excited about this investment for another reason. A while back, I compared social networks to governments. I noted that like governments, networks don't make anything, they just create the conditions necessary for their users to create value. Following that logic, a good network (like a good government) is one where the network architecture is so efficient that the network itself can get out of the way, imposing as little as possible on its users. A great network, gets out of the way, but also finds a way to peer produce the management of negative externalities. Craigslist, for instance, does this by crowdsourcing the management of fraud and abuse. The best network would then not only, get out of the way, and efficiently minimize negative externalities, it would also create positive externalities. Duolingo has done just that. The service delivers a fantastic language learning experience for free, while at the same time delivering another social good - the  translation of the web.   I realize there are other services that create positive externalities. Twitter, Tumblr, and Foursquare, for example, all curate the web as a by-product of their users' interactions with the service, but, by translating the web, Duolingo has set a new bar for the creation of direct, measurable, economic value. We welcome them to the portfolio."

Software patents are the problem not the answer,BradUSV,2010-02-19 11:05:47,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Nathan Myhrvold and I have exactly the same goal. We'd both like to promote useful innovations that have a positive social impact. But we have very different opinions about how to do it. Nathan believes the patent system is the answer, and I believe the patent system is the problem.  The New York Times reported on Nathan's approach yesterday and referenced an article he has written in the Harvard Business Review outlining his view.  The world needs a capital market for invention like the venture capital market for start-ups"" ... and  that ""creat[ing] a market where patents can be efficiently bought, sold, or licensed through investment funds that manage the high risks by amassing huge portfolios of patents and packaging them to maximize their value"" will accomplish this goal.  Nathan supports this argument by comparing the current market for intellectual property to the early days of the computer industry. He argues that in the 1970s people did not believe the software industry could be an independent business and that it would always be linked to hardware. He says that software industry developed for two reasons. First, software vendors persuaded software users to respect intellectual property rights through both education and lawsuits, and second, the vendors overcame system incompatibilities and developed solutions that would work on different computers.  Nathan suggests that a market for inventions would emerge if the same two conditions are met, and then offers his company Intellectual Ventures as a model for how to meet them.  I do not agree.  Here's why.  Let's start with software analogy. Put aside the fact that in the 70's software vendors used copyright law to prevent the outright copying of their software and not patents as Nathan proposes to do. The real reason the independent software industry emerged is that operating systems and APIs made it possible for independent software vendors to develop applications independently. They no longer had to ask permission of the hardware vendors.  This same characteristic of permissionless innovation led to the explosion of independently created services on the internet.  The rampant abuse of the patent system has created the opposite condition for the creators of software and web services today.  Not only is it becoming impossible to invent new services on the web without the permission of a patent holder who claims to own the intellectual property embodied in your invention, it is impossible to know who you need to ask permission of.  I recently spoke to an entrepreneur who put it this way.  I ignored my lawyer's advice not to do a patent search to avoid subjecting myself the possibility of treble damages for willful infringement.  I hired several firms to search for patents that our service might infringe. Each of them came back with completely different patents and each time I sent them back to do it again, they came back with still more different patents. When I searched myself in the patent database, each time I entered the same search query, it would return different results.  None of these patents seemed to cover what we did, so I eventually gave up.  Nathan sees the problem differently.  He describes the entire internet industry as pirates.  While respecting intellectual property rights is a cornerstone of some high tech industries-branded pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and wireless, for instance-that's sadly not the case in others, most notably software, computing and other internet related sectors. These 'winner takes most"" industries impose extreme competitive pressure on young firms to increase their market share by any means necessary, even copying the ideas of others. To this day, some software and internet companies take the very narrow view that saving money on patent licenses (by infringing) is good because it frees capital for expansion.  I have been investing in software and web services since 1993 and have worked in venture backed startups since 1985. I have never met the people Nathan is describing here. I have never been a party to a discussion about ignoring someone's intellectual property rights for the sake of market share or to free up expansion capital.  If anyone can point me to the clear cut abuses that Nathan is describing, I'd be grateful. My experience has been the opposite. As I described in this post, the companies I work with invest a huge amount of time and energy creating a service from scratch only to find after they have launched and become successful that a patent holder they have never heard of, operating (if they operate at all) in an entirely different market claims that our company has stolen their property. 
 
The problem is not the internet industry; the problem is software and business method patents.  Nathan, despite his mean spirited and uninformed (based on my experience) attack on the software and internet industry, indirectly acknowledges the weakness of software patents in his HBR article.
 
When he cites an inventor, he points to the inventor of the incandescent light bulb, Thomas Edison, not the creator of Facebook. When he describes inspiring inventions, he cites ""bone screws that can be adjusted remotely, using a wireless power source"" and ""a new kind of nuclear reactor that all but eliminates the need to enrich uranium"" not ""one click"" purchases on the web. And when he talks about the great companies that support stronger patent protection he mentions General Electric, Proctor & Gamble, 3M, DuPont, and Caterpillar, not Google, eBay or Facebook.
 
There is a reason for this. Even the average reader of the Harvard Business Review has a gut appreciation for the fundamental unfairness of software patents. Software is not the same as a drug compound. It is not a variable speed windshield wiper. It does not cost millions of dollars to develop or require an expensive approval process to get into the market. When it is patented, the ""invention"" is abstracted in the hope of covering the largest possible swath of the market. When software patents are prosecuted, it is very often against young companies that independently invented their technology with no prior knowledge of the patent.
 
I don't know a lot about the invention of things like drugs, windshield wipers, and bone screws, so I don't really have an opinion on whether or not the business model that Nathan proposes makes sense in that sphere. I am absolutely certain it makes no sense in software or web services. We have all benefited from the extraordinary innovation delivered first by the independent software industry and more recently by the web services industry. In both cases, this innovation was a direct result of the ability to innovate without permission. Nathan proposes to replace this world of decentralized innovation on open platforms with one dominated by a new gatekeeper, ""intellectual property market makers"". In this world, young companies, may not need to ask permission of Dell, Microsoft, or Verizon, before they launch a new web service, but they will have to negotiate with Nathan's firm to as he puts it ""get all the patents they need to roll out an innovative product faster and at the same time reduce the risk that they'll miss a necessary license and get blindsided by an infringement suit""
 
This is not a good idea."
Communicator: Done.  Replicator: Next.  The Future of Making Stuff.,albertwenger,2010-03-22 10:40:27,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"I am an unabashed Star Trek fan and was thrilled to see JJ Abrams breath new life into the franchise.  The original series popularized some technologies that seemed, well, futuristic.  But amazingly we now have one of them and are on the brink of another.  A modern cell phone is incredibly close to a Star Trek Communicator.  So it does not (yet) work in outer space -- but other than that you can simply press a little button on a tiny unit and talk to pretty much anyone else in the world.  The revolution that is brewing now will get us much closer to another seemingly impossible Star Trek technology: the Replicator.   You won't be able (for some time) to press a button and get a whole meal synthesized on the fly, but we are at the stage where a short time after pressing the button you can have a wide variety of objects appear magically.  These range from tiny, fully functional gears to large, colorful pieces of art and cover materials as broad as glass, ceramics, metal and plastic.  Yes, glass, ceramics and metal!  3D Printing is only the most amazing of a slew of new technologies that are revolutionizing how stuff is made.  There is also the printing of patterns on fabrics, the laser cutting of metals and wood and robotic assembly and packaging.  Here are some important implications of these technologies:  1. Lot size 1 production / Mass customization
Nike already has a significant business of customizing sneakers.  Companies such as Zazzle and Cafepress are experiencing rapid growth for customized objects.  Now this lot size 1 / mass customized production can be extended from the surface of objects to the actual object itself.  Sneakers that fit perfectly (hopefully coming soon!).  Dream figurines.  2. No / raw material inventories
Closely related is the fact that with these new technologies companies no longer need to keep inventories of finished or even semi-finished goods.  Instead, inventories will consist primarily of raw materials.  This means that the speed of innovation and change will pick up tremendously.  Physical objects can now be developed iteratively just like we have grown used to with web sites.  3. The softwarization of stuff
What makes software development so easy these days is that you don't need to know anything about the hardware on which it will run.  With manufacturing, designing and making were historically relatively tightly coupled: in order to design something that could be made you had to know a fair bit about how it would be made.  With the new manufacturing technologies not only can more and more of this translation be implemented inside of design tools, but like software it is also becoming easier to share and modify/integrate components.  This means that it becomes much easier for development to become iterative (just like software).   4. Open Sourcing of hardware
Directly related to the softwarization of stuff is that we are seeing the open sourcing of hardware.  Companies such as Buglabs and projects such as OScar and Open Source Ecology are working to turn traditionally closed systems into open source components that can be freely combined, extended and assembled into new products.  In 3D printing there are a variety of component designs that have already been open sourced.  For instance, this design for a dremel fuge explicitly acknowledges an open source shape library that was used.  The open source approach to making stuff means that individuals can make small contributions (similar to fixing a typo on Wikipedia) more easily and the overall process becomes accretive.  5. Democratization of manufacturing
We have observed in the past that the Internet is a democratizing force and we have based many of our investments on that thesis.  So far, however, that trend has applied only to bits.  The new manufacturing technologies will gradually extend this force to atoms.  As the right infrastructure comes into place, a tiny team or even a single engineer will be able to compete in the physical world the same way that is now possible online.  So how far are we along this path?  It is early days.  Probably a little too early to declare that atoms ""are"" the new bits.  But progress has been rapid and it feels distinctly as if we are at the cusp of rapid acceleration.  For a geek like myself it is impossible to look at the Cupcake CNC from Makerbot and not think of it as the Apple I of personal manufacturing.  At the same time as other 3D printers cost $100,000 or more, the Cupcake comes as a kit for $750.  That is two orders of magnitude cheaper.  Yes, there is some assembly required (Bre jokes that it's at the level of IKEA furniture) but it is easy to extrapolate to an Apple II, which will be the Makerbot in a box.  In the meantime, there is a growing list of things that can be printed with a Makerbot that can be found at Thingiverse.  In parallel to Makerbot driving the price of hardware way down, Shapeways has been developing a lively marketplace for 3D printing.  Shapeways connects folks who just want to buy a custom part with developers who create models and printing capacity for the actual production.  The beauty of such a marketplace is that it lets everyone focus on what they do best.  3D Modelers can optimize their designs without having to worry about operating a printer or shipping for fulfillment (they become the ""content"" creators for 3D printing).  For instance, the dremel fuge cited above is available, as are wonderful mathematical art objects (several of which are decorating my office) and a wide variety of jewelry. 3D Printers in turn can focus on optimizing the process and driving down the cost.  For people who just need stuff, Shapeways offers an e-commerce experience as simple as buying on Amazon.  As an aside, Shapeways has put up a neat series of videos about 3D printing on Youtube.  With so much happening, this is a fascinating time for anyone designing and making stuff.  If you belong to that group, we want to hear from you about what excites you the most!

Bidding Goodbye to Andrew,fredwilson,2010-03-23 15:51:56,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Four years ago this summer, Andrew Parker joined Union Square Ventures. Brad wrote this post welcoming Andrew to our firm and explaining how we found him through his blog and ours.  And today I get the task of announcing that Andrew is leaving our firm. Somehow Brad got the easier part of telling this story.  Ever since we started Union Square Ventures almost seven years ago, we've envisioned it as a partner driven firm where the partners do most of the work. We don't have a career path for young people, and we emphasize that with a two year and out analyst program.  Andrew tested that assumption. He taught himself all the things we didn't have the time or inclination to teach him. He got our investment theses quickly and he can recite them better than we can. He would remind us of them during our weekly team meetings and regularly brought us back to earth when we were starry eyed over something. He identified emerging startups like HeyZap and Foursquare before we did.  And so we started to think that maybe there was an exception to every rule. But we won't get the chance to find out if Andrew Parker will make a great VC at Union Square Ventures. Because he and his fiance Lisa are moving to Boston to start their new life where Lisa is doing her residency. If there is one thing even more important to us than our ""partner only"" mantra, it's all of us working out of one office and putting our families first.   So Andrew Parker is off to Boston. And we expect that he will indeed make a great VC. Just not at Union Square Ventures. It's our loss but a big gain to the world of startups, entrepreneurs, and venture capital, particularly those living in Boston.  We will indeed be replacing Andrew but we aren't yet sure how. We'll wrap our heads around that and report back shortly. I suspect we will once again post a job description on this blog and ask for a comment and a link to a web presence. That's how we found Andrew four years ago. That worked out well for both us and Andrew, and we are all wiser for the experience."
We Are Hiring,albertwenger,2010-04-12 07:42:13,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"It's Spring in New York. The pear trees and magnolias are in full bloom and everyone on the street is smiling, reminded again of irrepressible rhythm of the seasons.  That's the good news. The bad news is that another rhythm that shapes our lives at Union Square Ventures has also come full circle. A little over a week ago Fred announced that Andrew was following his fiancé to Boston where she will complete her medical training. Eric Friedman is also coming to the end of his two year stint as an analyst here and moving on to Foursquare.  The three of us are staring at the possibility of being on our own this summer.  In some ways that is not all bad. We have always believed in building a partner driven firm, where we all do our own work and can fully represent the firm to the outside world. On the other hand, Andrew and Eric have done a fabulous job finding holes and filling them and I, for one, am worried about running out of fingers to put in the dike when they leave.   So we are hiring. We plan to hire two people. We expect both to be rotational assignments. Our hope is that the successful candidates will spend a couple of years with us and then move on to a start up, or another venture capital firm or pursue an advanced degree.  In our conversations to date we have envisioned an Investment Analyst and a General Manager of the Union Square Ventures Network.  Here is a rough cut of the two job descriptions.   The Investment Analyst at Union Square Ventures is an integral member of the investment team. Today, Eric manages the agenda for our weekly meetings. We expect that practice to continue. We also expect the analyst to contribute to the conversations about future investments and the current portfolio.  The specific responsibilities include:

	Market Research
	Financial Analysis
	Due Diligence Support
  An ideal candidate would have:

	Strong analytical and quantitative skills
	Excellent Excel skills
	Deep knowledge of the technology of the internet
	Personal familiarity with a range of web services
	Prior programming/and or web design skills are a plus - not a requirement
  Like the Analyst, the General Manager of the Union Square Ventures Network is an integral member of the investment team.  They too will be expected to contribute to conversations about potential investments and existing portfolio companies. Unlike the analyst who will focus on supporting the partners as they make new investments, the GM of the USV Network will focus primarily on supporting our portfolio of 28 web services companies.  Because of our focused approach, many of our portfolio companies face similar challenges as they work to create and sustain user engagement, recruit talent, build relationships with partners, or design, code, and operate web services at scale. So it's no surprise that our portfolio companies are learning from each other. We have tried to facilitate that learning by hosting meetups and mailing lists, but we believe that we can do so much more.   It will be the job of the GM of the USV Network to build on our early work to create a useful and sustainable connection between the portfolio companies. Think of it as a community manager for the USV portfolio. The community is small, and private, but populated by people and companies who are having a big impact on the web.  The responsibilities of the General Manager will include:

	Build on the current platform of mailing lists and meetups by identifying and implementing social tools and services that create value for USV portfolio companies
	Identifying best practices in areas like social media, search, and online marketing and sharing those in the network
	Helping the portfolio companies recruit and hire great employees
	Organizing events like the annual portfolio company CEO summit
	Fostering connection online and offline between the functional  disciplines (marketing, sales, finance, etc) in each portfolio company
  The ideal candidate would have:

	Strong interpersonal skills
	Proven ability to foster communication and cooperation among diverse individuals online and offline
	Hands on experience with light weight tools such as Wikis, mailing lists, etc.
	Several years of management experience in flat, matrix, or loosely coupled organizations
  At Union Square Ventures, we basically do two things. We try to make the best investments we can and then we do everything we can to help our portfolio companies succeed. When we found ourselves with an opportunity to rethink how we do those two things, we decided to hire one person who focuses on the investment process and one who supports the portfolio. But, we are a small, collegial team.  We are interested in exploring this model, but we are not wed to it. At the end of the day, we will hire two people who will help us make investments and support the portfolio. If you think your skills would be a better fit in a slightly different alignment, feel free to make that point.  We are not flexible when it comes to cultural fit. We are a small team in a small office and it is very important to us that the candidates for these positions share our conviction about the transformational potential of the web. They should also be prepared to forcefully defend thoughtful positions on potential investments, but to also consider carefully the positions of others and to be intellectually honest and open to persuasion.  Perhaps most importantly, the successful candidates for these positions will be ""net native"". They will use web services in their personal and professional lives. They will ideally have an intuitive feel for what works and what doesn't on the web.  We assume that they will have a web presence, whether that is a profile on a social network site, a photo stream, an academic paper on social media, a blog or tumblelog, a lead role in an open source project, a reputation on Stack Exchange, or a spot on the leader board in Mafia Wars.  To help us with tracking, if you'd like to be considered, please contact us via JobScore for the Analyst or the General Manager role. Don't upload a resume. Instead, share your LinkedIn profile and use the ""cover letter"" to provide links to your web presence plus a way to reach you. We can't promise to respond to every inquiry, but you can be sure that if the links you share show off your contributions to the web, we will get in touch.  By the way, we are not prudes. We expect your web presence to represent who you are, not who you think an employer wishes you were, so don't waste a lot of time sanitizing your web presence before sending us there.  It will just confuse your friends.  We look forward to comments on this post, including suggestions about the roles, the qualifications and the process!"
Hiring Update #2,fredwilson,2010-04-19 15:58:23,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"As of a few minutes ago we have closed Jobscore for new candidates for our two open positions.

We will then start to reach out and schedule phone calls and meetings.  We recognize that all but two applicants will end up getting less than they hoped for out of this process. To that end, we would love to make interesting opportunities available to all who applied and plan to encourage our portfolio companies to look at our candidate pool once we have completed our process.  We are hoping that we can use Jobscore for that.  If you don't want to participate in Jobscore matching or any other matching, please make sure to opt out of the Jobscore network if you haven't done so already during your application.  In light of the volume of applications, we are also planning on using Jobscore to communicate the status of your application, including to those who we are moving out of the process.

Forums have a rich history online. Long prior to the web, tech geeks were dialing into BBS to communicate with one another.  BBS were the source of many behaviors and conventions we still use in communicating online today, such as the emoticon, and the basic question-and-answer threads you see regularly in long tail searches.
 
Yet, despite being around for 30+ years, forums have seen little innovation.  Many BBS users migrated to Usenet, and then Usenet moved to the web and the best of those threads became SEO honeypots open to indexing via Google Groups. On the web, vertically oriented forums emerged via self-hosted solutions like PHPBB. In each of these incarnations, the basic elements of the forum rarely changed.  A poster could start a new topic or respond to an existing topic. Administrators could moderate or create sticky topics, and community members without permissions had to request these changes from moderators. Perhaps the most valuable innovation was the introduction of threading conversations, so it was easier to determine which posts were in response to other posts. But in the scope of what was possible, this innovation was rather incremental and small. The general style of forums has been consistent for 30+ years.
 
And consuming forums as an end-user arriving from a long tail search result pages has always been difficult.  If you're looking for an answer to the Volvo keyless entry reprogramming question, you will likely land in the middle of a conversation on an automotive enthusiasts forum where your question is asked and answered across a couple pages of conversation.  There's no way to determine if the answer to your question is authoritative, high quality, or outdated without reading the entire conversation thread, which can sometimes span across hundreds of responses for particularly controversial topics.  
 
Yet, navigating these messy forums is often rewarding... you can find industry experts answering difficult questions for free that a business or person might normally pay a consultant hundreds of dollars an hour to answer. The problem of finding these hidden gems inside forums has been long apparent to us.
 
It is in the context of this problem and value proposition that we are delighted to announce our latest investment: Stack Overflow.  Many readers of this blog may already be familiar with Stack Overflow via the popular blogs of Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, the company's co-founders.  Joel and Jeff were particularly frustrated by the long tail searches on programming topics, which almost always directed users to a forum trapped behind a paywall called Experts Exchange.  Joel and Jeff, and many other programmers, were annoyed by the experience of hitting the Experts Exchange paywall (some developers have even written browser extensions and Greasemonkey scripts to remove all references to Experts Exchange from search engine results pages).  So, Joel and Jeff decided to build Stack Overflow as, in their words, an ""anti-Experts-Exchange"" to solve this problem.
 
We at Union Square Ventures see Stack Overflow as a substantial step forward in the innovation of forums.  Borrowing the best features from popular user-generated platforms like Reddit and Wikis, users can edit and correct any answer to questions, and vote up the best answers so that a casual consumer arriving from a Google search can quickly and confidently determine the right answer to the original question. Additionally there is a reputation system built into the site that the site's most passionate users really care about, which helps users understand who is authoritative and trustworthy on specific niche topics.  We have been hiring at Union Square Ventures recently, and we were delighted to see a couple candidates point us to their Stack Overflow reputation points and profiles as a piece of their web presence, which is evidence that Stack Overflow users really care about their reputation on the site.
 
These innovations, amonst others, made Stack Overflow uniquely different from prior forum and Q&A sites. And thus it took off.  In two years Joel, Jeff, and the rest of the Stack Overflow team grew the site (and a network of sister sites on similar niche verticals) to 7.2MM global monthly unique visitors. That impressive traffic growth is a byproduct of a larger qualitative success. Stack Overflow has created a system for sourcing thoughtful answers to highly technical questions, and the valuable data exhaust emitted from the Q&A process is the profiles of the answerers. These profiles can be used to identify the best experts in specific technical domains, which sets up an interesting native business model: aiding recruiting.  As evidence of this success in action, Brad Burnham recounted to me a very telling story about the growth and popularity of Stack Overflow: Brad was flying back to New York on a flight and seated next to an iPhone developer.  The subject of Stack Overflow came up and the developer said the site had quickly because his #1 resource for finding answers to the questions he encountered in Objective C programming.  But, he was having some trouble building a reputation on the site because all the good questions in his domain of expertise were getting answered too quickly. He said he felt like the loser on Jeopardy, who could never hit the buzzer in time to answer the question before his fellow players. When Brad heard this he knew that Stack Overflow had hit a rich vein of talent in building their community.  The founders were impressed by the growth and quality of the network and thought the underlying system they built could be used in other technical and niche verticals. They built Stack Exchange as a platform for rolling your own Stack Overflow-style site and have seen some encouraging success in niches like advanced Mathematics research. So, the conclusion was to raise venture capital in order to scale the platform across a variety of new verticals. Clearly, we agreed that was a good idea.
 
We at USV are delighted to be working with Joel, Jeff and an impressive roster of angel investors and advisors on this opportunity. Brad will be joining the board of directors, and we look forward to working together to help Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network of sites grow over the coming years."

A new member of the USV team,christinacaci,2010-06-08 14:33:24,1,0,[u'christinacaci'],"Like many of you, I began reading the Union Square Ventures blog because of Albert, Brad, and Fred's open discussions of the disruptions caused by new technology. I've since learned a tremendous amount both from reading the posts and comments and from watching the posts become investment theses and then actual investments. 
 
True to form, when USV was looking to hire an analyst and a general manager, they advertised with a blog post. As someone who admires USV and spent much of the last few years thinking about and working on emerging mobile services, I was excited to apply. One thing led to another, and this is my first week as a USV analyst. Blogging and debating ideas has become a key part of USV's culture, and I'll be contributing, here, on my blog, and on Twitter. I'm looking forward to diving in, but first, a quick introduction:  My name is Christina, and I graduated from Stanford with a BA in Economics and an MS in Management Science and Engineering, a program that combined industrial engineering, human-computer interaction, and product design. Most recently, I worked on projects for telecom and financial services companies as a consultant with the Boston Consulting Group in New York. Prior to BCG, I worked for Deutsche Telekom/T-Mobile in Berlin on a small team that uses design research to develop new mobile services. Much of my work focused on the digital norms and social etiquettes that are forming around new devices and online services.
 
While in Berlin, I began working with FrontlineSMS:Credit, a startup that offers a platform to facilitate money transfers via SMS between financial institutions and their customers. Like many mobile banking platforms, FrontlineSMS:Credit is focused on projects in the developing world and capitalizes on two powerful disruptions: the emergence of mobile banking and the expansion of financial services to people who previously had no access.
 
I've also been fortunate to spend some of the last few years living and working in East Africa and Southeast Asia. Seeing technologies adopted around the world has provided one lens through which I view the disruptions caused by new technologies.  I'm excited to explore these ideas, as well as many others, at Union Square, and I'm very much looking forward to continuing this conversation with all of you. "
Web Services as Governments,BradUSV,2010-06-10 09:57:31,2,0,"[u'BradUSV', u'LonnyLot']","This spring Apple, Facebook, and Twitter, made controversial announcements. Apple announced the terms of service for the iPhone OS 4, that restricted how applications developers could use analytics data. Facebook launched Facebook Credits, and a completely different privacy policy. And Twitter ""filled holes"" in its service with its own Blackberry and iPhone applications and announced plans for its own URL shortener. It was a very busy couple of weeks in April, and I was not sure what to make of it all. Was Apples clamping down on analytics providers in the iPhone App store a clumsy control move or a needed protection of their user's privacy? Was Twitter's launch of its own iPhone app a threat to applications developers or a boon?  My frame of reference for thinking about these increasingly important platforms was not helping me make sense of the announced changes.   Apple, Facebook, and Twitter are all companies operating in a global economy under the laws of one or more countries, but thinking of them as profit driven entities, making things in competition with other companies doesn't really help. A for profit company is expected to maximize returns for its shareholders. In that light, Facebook's move to control the economic activity on its platform through Facebook Credits makes perfect sense, but I was not convinced it was the right thing for them to do.   As I thought about it, it became clear that web platforms really don't make much. Instead, they create the conditions that encourage others to invest their time and energy to create useful services. The value of Twitter is not in the software that runs on their servers; it is in the content that 180 million people contribute to their network - same with Facebook. Many would argue that Apple makes things, but even there, the full experience of the iPhone has a lot to do with the 200,000 applications that others created to run on the device.   A lot of people have begun using the term ecosystem to describe these big platforms. That captures their decentralized, emergent character, but ecosystems do not have a central point of control. Apple decided to eliminate third party analytics between one release and the next. That doesn't happen in an ecosystem.  The right analogy is a government.  Facebook is a government. Facebook's users are citizens, and Facebook's applications developers are the private companies that drive much of the economy.  Apple. Twitter, Myspace, Craigslist, Foursquare, Tumblr and every other large network of engaged users (including some services of Google) plays a similar role. We have always tacitly acknowledged this. We talk about these networks as communities, communities have governments.  It is easier to make sense of this spring's events if you think about large web platforms explicitly as governments.  Was Apple's move an unwarranted extension of state power into what had been private sector analytics, or a necessary and restrained regulatory constraint on companies that may not have been acting in the citizen's interest? Did Twitter's announcement of its own URL shortener suggest the state planned to move into an area better left in private hands or are they simply providing basic infrastructure like a highway - a natural state monopoly that benefits everyone.   Once you start thinking about large web platforms as governments, the logical question is what kind of government are they.  One thing is for sure - none of these platforms are democracies. They are oligarchies controlled by founders, investors or shareholders. That may not be at all bad. As long as citizens (users) can move freely from one government to another with little switching cost, there is no reason to burden these polities with the inherent inefficiencies of popular democracy. But that does put a special premium on emigration policies and property rights. Do I own my data, can I export it freely? It also suggests that large networks that have strong network effects may someday need other incentives to act in the best interests of their citizens.   So how do the events of this spring look through this lens?   Apple looks like a monarchy. The monarch got angry when he found out that many of the applications that ran on the iPhone collected device information which developers use to improve the reliability and performance of their apps, but that that same information allowed analytics providers to access state secrets,  like the existence of a new device - the iPad.  He reacted impulsively, as monarchs sometimes do, and banned all analytics providers, without having an alternative in place for developers.  Apple argues that the new terms of service for OS 4 are designed to protect the privacy of users but if you saw Steve Jobs react to the question from Chris Fralic at the All Things D conference, it's pretty clear what drove the new terms of service.    Facebook looks a little like the Russia of Vladimir Putin. Facebook was originally a state economy. The vast majority of the services were provided initially by Facebook. Later, they liberalized their economy with the introduction of the Facebook API. That unleashed a torrent of investment and innovation, but also some bad behavior and unsavory characters. Now the state is reasserting control over the economy with the introduction of Facebook Credits.  They would argue this is for the benefit of all citizens and well behaved private companies, and that a common currency and a state controlled monetary policy will benefit everyone. Others might say using the currency as a mechanism to tax everyone in the economy at a 30% rate is aggressive in light of what it actually costs to run this particular state.   Twitter, by comparison, seems to have a more limited view of state power. They can still appear arbitrary and capricious, especially to companies who make URL shorteners, or iPhone clients, but they did not use state power to ban anyone, or to extract a tax. They may well introduce a currency in the future or more restrictive terms of service, but they seem from a distance (we are investors but I am not on the board) to have a qualitatively different relationship with the companies in their economy and the citizens in their state.   In the end, the big networks on the web will all have to find a balance between state power and private initiative. Despite Craig's progressive personal politics, Craigslist lives the credo ""a government governs best that governs least"". They make very few changes to the site, and then, only when users ask for it. Their business model is restrained. They only make money in a few of their 455 cities and only on a few types of postings. The business model emerged as the result of user requests to stop abusive automated reposting by real estate and employment agencies. This restrained approach created a phenomenally profitable business. It also has led to conflicts with their host (real world) governments. A number of headline grabbing attorneys general want Craiglist to assert more state power to eliminate some uses of the service they feel do not fit with broader social norms.   If you accept the analogy of web services as governments, the example of Craigslist offers a couple of insights. First, it's possible to be fabulously profitable as a restrained government, but perhaps at the expense of top line revenue (or the government's share of total GDP). And second, that no web service is an island. Web services will compete with each other for the time and attention of their users and for investment from the private sector (applications developers), but they will do this in the context of their host government's who are also competing for tax revenues and private sector investment.   So as you watch the large web services evolve, think about how they are balancing the relationship between the state and the private sector? What does Facebook's introduction of Facebook Credits say about its monetary policy? What is Apples foreign policy? Do they act unilaterally promoting their own proprietary standards or do they act multilaterally embracing international standards? What is Twitter's industrial policy? Do they invest in state owned services or encourage decentralized economic development? The choices these platforms make reveal a lot about who they are, and ultimately how well they serve the companies operating in their economies and the citizens who live there."

Joining Union Square Ventures,br_ttany,2013-01-16 16:19:30,1,0,[u'br_ttany'],"Hi, I'm Brittany Laughlin. I'm the new General Manager of the USV Network. As Gary wraps up his two year rotation, I'll be taking the reins, working to strengthen relationships among the community of people that work for our 40+ portfolio companies.   I've spent the majority of my career learning to support, start and grow businesses, so this is an exciting opportunity to learn more by doing. I studied Marketing and International Business at NYU Stern and minored in Film at Tisch. After graduation, I joined American Express OPEN to work on customer acquisition and new product development.   After a few years at AmEx, my increasing involvement in the NY tech community inspired me to co-found a social travel recommendation engine, gtrot. We raised over $1.5M from Lightbank, grew to become a 10 person team and attracted tens of thousands of users. After two years, I left to focus on a problem that had been central to my role as COO of gtrot: sourcing quality development talent.   Having grown up in a Navy family, I found an untapped market in our military. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were beginning to wind down, I founded Incline, a program to train military veterans in web development and offer job placement opportunities in the technology sector. Today, the program works with 80+ NYC companies, including a few USV portfolio companies, and is currently accepting applications.   I am excited to explore topics on talent, hiring/training, company growth and user acquisition in my role as GM. I also look forward to learning as much as possible from the USV team, our portfolio companies and from you, the USV community.   When I'm not working, you'll likely find me planning a trip to somewhere new (7 continents and 39 countries so far), trying new food, or finding new athletic challenges (snowboarding, yoga, surfing, CrossFit). I also blog about my interests in education, artificial intelligence, art and design at  likesandlaunch.tumblr.com. You can also find me on Twitter @br_ttany."

Policies to Encourage Startup Innovation,BradUSV,2010-07-27 12:01:03,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We have commented a number of times in a number of ways on this blog about how technology startups can no longer afford to ignore politics. When the tech startup world was focused on core infrastructure like chips and routers, and touched a small portion of the population, we thrived in comfortable isolation from the rest of the world. Now, the most interesting innovations are happening at the applications layer and technology has jumped from a small early adopter market to the mainstream. Everything is suddenly impacted by public policy and we no longer have a choice about engaging in the process.  With that in mind, we pulled a few folks from the New York tech community together last week for a dialogue with a key policymaker in Washington, D.C..     A few interesting themes emerged from the audience. There was wide consensus that New York had an unprecedented opportunity to emerge as a global center for tech and media innovation and that technology startups could be the largest part of the New York City economy in 10-15 years. As the opportunity has shifted from the infrastructure to the applications, the critical success factor for startups has shifted from electrical engineering to social engineering. While New York has good engineering schools, they have never been regarded as the best. New York has, on the other hand, always been a Mecca for people who want to influence other people through art, literature, design, or marketing.  Those people seem to relish the diversity and richness of life in New York. Everyone acknowledged that this new opportunity was not created by government, but that public policy over the next few years could either accelerate the momentum or stifle it.   Several issues were presented specifically:   1) Net Neutrality - almost everyone in the room worked for startups that depend on direct access to consumers over the internet. With the shift to broadband most of us now depend on only two providers for access to the internet. There was a general concern that access providers are motivated to discriminate among applications, and now with deep packet inspection technology, they have the means. There was specific concern that without the appropriate structural separation, the merger of Comcast and NBCU would limit startup's access to consumers. Ultimately, such discrimination by an access provider would stifle startup innovation.    2) Immigration - Many of the entrepreneurs in the room were immigrants. All of them wanted access to the best talent regardless of where that talent was born. The group recognized the significance of getting an immigration reform bill passed in the first half of next year, where a key provision of that bill would be that any foreign student who graduated with a Masters or a PHD in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math (STEM) would automatically be given a green card. 
  3) Consumer Protection on the Internet - The entrepreneurs in the room were concerned that hasty and uncoordinated intervention by different government agencies could stifle innovation. The conversation was especially pointed around the issue of privacy. In the end, I think everyone agreed that a framework was needed to provide the predictability entrepreneurs need to operate and the flexibility they need to innovate, while still protecting consumers.  
  4) Patent reform - there was a funny moment when I could not recall the list of policy issues I had prepared and was reaching for my notes when several people in the audience shouted patent reform.  This has become a huge issue that disproportionally hurts New York startups because they are more likely to create applications than infrastructure.  Almost no one in the audience would object to a patent being granted in biotech, greentech, or materials science, but software and business method patents have become a barrier to innovation not a boon. Many people in the room have had to fight off patent holders wielding very broad software patents. Often the startup had never heard of the patent holder because they operated in entirely different markets (if they operated at all). In the most egregious cases, startup companies who could not afford to fight, have had to settle and as part of the settlement have licensed their technology to the patent holder to enable them to do the thing they claim to have invented.   Together these issues, and a few smaller ones (open government data and lower net worth requirements for angels) make up a ""web startup innovation"" agenda.  This is not the same as an innovation agenda. Many government policies intended to increase innovation are focused on big company, big science, and big budget research projects.  It is not even a startup innovation agenda, because other startups, in energy, or biotech, for instance, may have a different view on some of these issues. Web startup innovation is different.  It is capital efficient, emergent, organic and decentralized. It is also what is happening in New York. Our challenge is to make sure our politicians understand the value being created by web startups and their unique policy needs.  We need your help in two areas. First, we need to define a ""web startup innovation"" policy agenda. We seemed, last week, to have consensus on the points above, but we need to hear from more web entrepreneurs about how public policy affects their ability to innovate. What are four or five things that government can do to help and another four or five things government might do to hurt this important sector?  We could use your help compiling that list. Second, we need to become more effective policy advocates.  The group last week represents the most important growth sector in the New York economy. Collectively, those 40 entrepreneurs are likely responsible for more net new jobs in the city of New York over the last two years than any single company, so we are important, vital and growing. Our challenge is to figure out how to organize and concentrate our advocacy of a ""web startup innovation"" policy agenda so that we can help our representatives in government help us."
A Threat to Startups,BradUSV,2010-08-10 12:26:01,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We believe that Google and Verizon's proposed policy principles to preserve an open Internet came out of a good faith effort to bring some clarity to the market for Internet applications and access. But we fear that this agreement is a compromise that does not serve the next great startup enterprise well.  Google, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare are just a few of the thousands of companies that flourished on the Internet, precisely because there were no gatekeepers and no toll takers.  That market architecture is the result of the original layered architecture of the Internet.  With the move from dial up to broadband and with the deployment of packet inspection technology by the telephone companies and cable companies that now provide internet access to most American consumers, the integrity of the layered architecture of the Internet is threatened.  Google and Verizon's proposed policy principles, while well intended,  do not restore the integrity of the Internet's layers. Instead, they seek to manage the problems created by their demise.  We have two key concerns.  
	At a time when more and more Internet services are accessed wirelessly from mobile devices, the Google/Verizon proposal offers no guidance. On wireless Internet access, it calls only for transparency. There is no assurance that consumers will be able to get to the applications and the content on their wireless devices. There is no restriction on network management practices that discriminate against specific applications.  	The proposed framework for wireline Internet access is complex and not easily enforced. The access providers are prohibited from discriminating against specific applications providers only if it would cause ""meaningful harm to competition or to users."" The network management provision provides broad latitude for Internet access providers to interfere with applications layer services.
  Between the lack of any protection on the wireless side and the qualifiers and complexity on the wireline side, young startup companies will have difficulty finding financing and building businesses of scale.  If an Internet access provider discriminates against a startup directly or through its network management practices, it is unlikely the startup could afford a long and expensive process to seek redress. So this proposal favors the incumbent applications and access providers.  (reposted from the NYTimes.com series Who Gets Priority on the Web)  Updated: Albert (Net Neutrality Is Critical for Innovation) and Fred (Regulation Strangulation) chime in."
Internet Architecture and Innovation,BradUSV,2010-08-10 19:52:30,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Barbara van Schewick's book, Internet Architecture and Innovation, is out and everyone who cares about the future of the Internet should click here and buy a copy. It is not an easy read, but the architecture of the Internet and the ways in which that architecture is directly responsible for the explosion of innovation over the last 15 years is not an easy topic. 
 
Thoughtful, well intentioned people find themselves on different sides of the net neutrality debate. Internet access providers have spun network neutrality as needless and overreaching government intervention into a vibrant, competitive market. On the other side, net roots activists attack any innovation in the physical network as a threat to the Internet. Barbara's book offers a comprehensive framework for sorting through the issues.
 
In the end, she concludes that the architecture of the internet is changing - that the economic interests of the internet access providers are not the same as the interests of the applications developers or end users, that there is not enough competition in the local loop to provide market discipline, so without intervention, innovation on the Internet will suffer. 
 
Barbara challenges policy makers and advocates to imagine policy at an architectural level - a difficult task for regulators used to managing specific behaviors or politicians who prefer to hand out checks at ground breaking ceremonies. She argues that protecting the original design principles of the Internet is the most efficient regulatory regime. In effect, she is saying that only by learning to regulate at an architectural level can we create flourishing competitive markets that do not require the constant attention of over worked and ill prepared regulators.
 
Barbara makes a compelling case. I hope everyone involved in this noisy debate reads this book.

Shapeways,albertwenger,2010-09-22 10:40:03,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Earlier this year we wrote about how there is a  revolution going on in manufacturing due to the advances in 3D printing.  The New York Times also recently covered the many businesses springing up around this technology.  We are excited to announce today that together with Index Ventures we are backing the team from Shapeways in creating a marketplace for the design and 3D printing of objects.  Shapeways motto is ""Personalized products FOR you and BY you"" which captures the two goals for the company.  The ""BY"" part of the motto is about empowering 3D designers to sell products without having to invest in their own production capacity (and is a good example of our belief in the Internet's force in shifting ""power to the people"").  For designers Shapeways is constantly expanding what can be done, such as making a raft of new materials available including silver and even glass.    The ""FOR"" part is about making it easy for anyone to find a product, customize it further and then have it delivered all without having to know anything about the underlying 3D printing technology.  Objects available on Shapeways range from art to games, to jewelry.  There is virtually no limit to what may eventually be available.  If you are intrigued by 3D printing but have no idea what it is or how it works, Shapeways has put together some great videos which you can find on their Youtube channel.    Shapeways was founded in the Netherlands but with this financing the company will move its headquarters to New York City.  With Makerbot here and Shapeways arriving, we are also excited to see New York becoming a center for a new kind of manufacturing."

Edmodo,albertwenger,2010-12-06 22:02:30,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Early in 2009 we organized a one-day event in New York which we called ""Hacking Education"" -- the idea was to bring together people from different fields for a discussion on how to disrupt and improve education using technology in general and the web in particular.  The spirited and inspiring discussion that day prompted us to start looking at investment opportunities in education.  We set out looking with a fairly specific set of ideas in mind.  First, much as with all other content, we believe the future of educational content are ""micro-chunks.""  These can be videos on Youtube or on the amazing Khanacademy, or Flash simulations, or Scratch Java applets, or blog posts.   The Internet has already turned into an incredible wellspring of these kind of learning objects and many, many more will be created going forward.  Second, we firmly believe in the Internet's ability to give ""power to the people"" by supporting decentralized decision making.  In education, the decision makers who most need to be empowered are teachers.  DonorsChoose has shown how effective this can be.  With learning objects becoming available and improving rapidly all over the Internet, the historic process of states and/or districts making decisions about educational content is becoming untenable (which made sense at a time when textbooks would last a decade).  Instead, teachers need to be able to easily pick what works best for their students.  Third, students today are growing up with the Internet and mobile devices.  They will measure the systems they use in school, and for learning more generally, against the websites they visit and the apps they download to their phones.  We therefore believe that to succeed, someone needs to deliver an experience that feels instantly familiar and comfortable for a net native generation.  The team at Edmodo shares these beliefs, and we are super excited to be working with them as investors.  Edmodo is based on the premise that teachers need an easy way to share content with their students.  Around this central concept, Edmodo has created a social and mobile experience that appears to be resonating well with teachers and students.  The team at Edmodo, existing investor Learn Capital, and we are committed to supporting the learning community in schools across the country and the world."
Internet Access Should Be Application-Agnostic,BradUSV,2010-12-08 18:38:24,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Julius Genachowski, the Chairman of the FCC, recently announced that he would ask the FCC to adopt rules to protect the open Internet at its open meeting on December 21st. We applaud the Chairman's effort, but we worry the proposed framework, as it is currently drafted, will not result in the free and open Internet that is his goal.
 
The proposed rule has several problems: 
it prohibits only unjust and unreasonable discrimination but does not clearly define those terms,broadband access providers are not prohibited from charging web services like Google, Facebook or Twitter a fee to reach consumers or to get faster access to consumers, and users who access the Internet over wireless networks have few protections.  If these concerns are not addressed, access providers could use their ability to control access to the Internet to control the market for Internet applications and services.   I remember too well, the experience of investing in cable television programming start-ups back in the 90s when there was limited channel capacity on cable networks and the companies that controlled access to consumers made it very clear that they would need to own 20% of your company before they would agree to carry your programming on their network. The Internet we know today exists only because, until now, there have been no gatekeepers between consumers and service providers. We need to keep it that way.  The good news is that the FCC can balance the interests of web services innovators and consumers with those of telephone and cable companies without changing the substance of the proposed rule simply by defining application-specific discrimination as unreasonable.  Barbara van Schewick, a professor at the Stanford Law School, describes this approach here. She says the correct approach is:   ""A non-discrimination rule that would ban all application-specific discrimination (i.e. discrimination based on applications or classes of applications), but would allow application-agnostic discrimination.""   The brilliance of this approach is that it offers cable and telephone companies great flexibility to package and price their services and to manage their networks without harming investment and innovation in web services.   If a user wants more packets or less latency, an access provider should be able to sell that to them. But for that access service to meet the test of being application-agnostic, the choice of when to use these services and for which applications must be left to the user.  Similarly, if a user consumes a disproportionate share of packets at certain times of day, a network provider should be able to temporarily reduce that user's throughput to avoid degrading the experience of others. These actions would not threaten a free and open Internet because they are targeted at a consumer's use of network capacity, not a specific application.  On the other hand, if access providers throttled only the bandwidth available to BitTorrent to deal with congestion, that would clearly be application-specific discrimination. Blocking or throttling video would be discrimination against a class of applications. 
 
This approach works equally well for wireless.  If an older wireless network does not have the capacity to handle lots of packets at peak times, it can reasonably limit the number of packets available to users. When congestion is eased it can open up the pipe again.    This is reasonable network management that does not distort the competitive market for web services. Blocking or discriminating against a specific web service like Skype or against a whole class of web services like streaming video would be prohibited under this framework.   If it is not possible to solve all network management problems on older wireless networks in an application-agnostic way, there could be an exception; but the presumption should be that network management would be as application-agnostic as possible.  If cable and telephone companies intend to use their control over consumer's access to the Internet to extract outsize profits from the innovative companies working in the dynamic and competitive market for Internet services, it should be pretty clear to the FCC that they cannot reconcile their interests with those of consumers and innovators.  If, on the other hand, access providers are, as they say, concerned only about their ability to invest in their network and manage it responsibly, they will support this application-agnostic regulatory framework.  This is not just a problem for venture capital investors. There is a great post here that summarizes all of these issues from an entrepreneur's perspective.
 
We believe it is in everyone's interest to improve the current proposal by:
defining any application-specific discrimination as unreasonable,extending that reasonableness test to include wireless Internet access, andmaking it clear that pay-to-play access fees (whether for access to users or faster access to users) are prohibited.  If you agree, we encourage you to write to Chairman Genachowski, Commissioner Copps, and, Commissioner Clyburn, Commisioner McDowell, and Commissioner Baker and urge them to work together to make this modest but important change before bringing the rule to a vote later this month. 
 
We also encourage your you to exercise your own authority and influence, using the services that you use everyday to let the FCC know you understand the problem and will support their effort to create an application-agnostic regulatory framework:
 
1. Post your thoughts on your own blog.
2. Tell your friends on Facebook
3. Post this on Tumblr, and 
4. Tweet this to your followers on Twitter.

CircleUp,aweissman,2013-05-06 17:18:45,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"As venture capitalists, we understand how valuable an injection of capital into an early-stage, fast-growing business can be. But our industry has a particular set of economics, one that has skewed the availability of equity investment towards startups in the technology sector. Yet, despite a lack of access to upfront capital, entrepreneurs are constantly innovating in all areas of our economy. One of the most vibrant verticals is consumer products, with over 50,000 new consumer and retail companies started every year. These businesses are drivers of economic growth.  CircleUp has created an equity crowdfunding marketplace, enabling investors to own pieces of small but fast-growing consumer and retail businesses. Since last April, entrepreneurs have used CircleUp to raise over $10 million in equity, each in an average of only 61 days. The list of successful companies include Episencial, a producer of skin care products developed by its CEO, Kim Walls, a skin-care expert; Peeled Snacks, natural snack foods, founded by Noha Waibsnaider after working at a larger consumer products company; and Raen Optics, a maker of awesome eyewear started by two friends out of their boutique creative agency. These companies average over $1 million in yearly sales and more than 70% in annual growth.   This technology-enabled marketplace has created an entirely new system of allocation of capital and expertise. CircleUp has standardized the investment process (no paper is used), provided transparency and the ability to easily share data, and lowered the cost of investing for both investors and companies. Plus, these are products that investors can use themselves (making due diligence fun). For investors, the platform is designed to create trust and provide information in an open manner. For companies, the marketplace gives them efficient access to interested investors to help them grow, saving them months of manual fundraising time.  This kind of peer-funding network has the potential to expand the types of investors and entrepreneurs that can participate in private investing. We are excited to announce that we have become investors in Ryan, Rory and the team at CircleUp."
SoundCloud,fredwilson,2011-01-07 06:57:59,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"The web has been largely a silent affair for its first fifteen years.   Part of this is that the music industry has struggled with the web and what it means for its business model. Part of it is that podcasting and other forms of talk on the web have not yet gone mainstream. And the biggest part of it is that there has not been a wildly popular open audio sharing platform with simple APIs like YouTube and Vimeo in video, Facebook and Flickr in photos, Blogger and Wordpress in long form text, and Twitter in short form text/link sharing.  We think SoundCloud is on its way to becoming that wildly popular open platform for audio expression and sharing on the web and mobile devices. A few months ago, Union Square Ventures, along with our friends at Index Ventures, invested in SoundCloud and I have joined the Board.   For those unfamiliar with SoundCloud, I suggest you get familiar. Here's my audio page. It's pretty empty because I just got the SoundCloud app on my Android and I've just started creating and sharing audio. Here is the SoudCloud page for S-Curve Records, an independent record label my wife and I are personal investors in. Here is the SoundCloud page for my friend Dylan Chenfeld who has a band along with his brother Noah and a few friends. Here is a page of popular SoundCloud podcasts. Here is a page of popular SoundCloud tracks this week.  But the most important thing about SoundCloud is that it is an open platform. You don't need to go to SoundCloud to experience all of this audio. If the audio exists on SoundCloud, it can exist on anywhere on the web and mobile devices. Some of the tracks on this Snoop Dog fan page on Facebook are hosted at SoundCloud.  There are over 100 apps for web and mobile that have been built with SoundCloud inside. They are listed here. If you are a web/mobile developer and want to add audio to your app, check out SoundCloud. I am confident you'll like what you see.  SoundCloud is located in Berlin and is building a team in the bay area. It's a fantastic company to work for. Berlin's a fun place to live and work and the company has a culture that emphasizes both technical excellence and creativity. It is full of special people.   You can read SoundCloud's post on USV and Index joining their team here."
The Opportunity Fund,fredwilson,2011-01-15 07:40:19,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We founded Union Square Ventures in 2003 to invest in the applications layer of the web. Over the last seven years, we have refined that investment focus. We now invest almost exclusively in Internet services that create large networks. Some might think this focus is narrow. We don't see it that way at all. We believe the irresistible economics of Internet networks will ultimately transform the entire global economy. We continue to be very excited by the opportunity to invest in that transformation.  Early on, we recognized that investing in web services was different than investing in chips, routers and enterprise software. The start-ups are more capital efficient. Differentiation is more about user experience than proprietary technology. Defensibility is more about network effects than patents. We have designed our small, collegial, partner driven firm specifically for this new opportunity. Smaller fund sizes allow us to invest only as much as an entrepreneur needs and our successful portfolio companies can have a big impact on the funds' returns.   Since 2004, the opportunity to invest in networks has evolved. In 2004 the entire market capitalization of the social media sector was probably less than $100M. Today a single company in that sector is valued at over $50B. The amount of venture capital focused on the sector has exploded. Networks that did not exist in 2004 now consume a huge chunk of users' time and attention, making the launch of new networks more challenging. The opportunity to invest in networks has changed, and once again we are changing with it.  Today we can publicly announce the formation of the Union Square Ventures Opportunity Fund. This fund is meant to complement our core funds, not take us in a new direction. We will continue to be obsessively focused on the leverage of large networks and their resulting transformation of the global economy. The availability of this additional investment vehicle will allow us to 1) continue to invest in our most established and successful companies, 2) invest in more established networks that have been funded initially by others, 3) invest in special situations like the spin out of a network of scale, and 4) respond to attractive opportunities as the broader market continues to evolve.  The Opportunity Fund will be roughly the same size as our 2008 core fund. Our core funds will continue to define our business. We are very conscious of the risk that this additional pool of capital will cause us to drift towards later stage investing. To avoid that we have constructed this pool of capital to provide additional capacity only when we need it. We have told the investors in the Opportunity Fund (almost all of whom are investors in our core funds) that we are not committing to put the entire fund to work. And we are charging fees only on the capital that is actually invested. We believe these choices will result in a strong alignment of interests with our investors.  We are also thrilled to welcome John Buttrick to our firm as a partner in the Opportunity Fund. John has been a friend, advisor, and investor in USV since the very start of our firm. He is a highly skilled public and private markets investor who was a top deal lawyer before leaving the legal world for the investment world a decade ago. John's experience with larger, more complex transactions will add a new and valuable dimension to our firm.  For entrepreneurs, this means that if you are leveraging the economics of Internet-based networks to transform some aspect of the global economy, Union Square Ventures can be a partner, whether you are just launching your service, funding rapid growth, or spinning your business out of a larger entity. We can work with you if you need $250,000 or $25,000,000. We can invest in New York, San Francisco, London, or Berlin, and most places in between. We hope you'll think of USV as stage-agnostic, highly-focused investors who can add value to your company. That's how we see ourselves. With the Opportunity Fund, we are better equipped to deliver that offering to you."
Kik,fredwilson,2011-03-06 10:27:17,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"At Union Square Ventures, we seek to invest in large networks of engaged users. And we believe that the new beachhead for creating large networks is the mobile device.  When you look at the engaged user on the mobile device, the thing you notice is that messaging is the killer app. People like to talk and increasingly people like to text. But sms has all sorts of issues. It costs money to send a text. There has been a maddening lack of innovation in the sms channel.  So it makes total sense that something will come along and replace texting and we believe that thing is mobile push. And we think the killer app for mobile push is messaging. And for the past year, we have been seeking to make an investment in mobile messaging built on the push channel.  There are no lack of startups innovating in this sector. In fact, there are a ton of them. It is a very crowded space and we have had the benefit of meeting with and getting to know many of the teams working in this sector. There are a handful of excellent teams and excellent apps in this sector. Choosing a team to back has been hard for us.  Today, we have finally made that choice. Our newest portfolio company, Kik, has announced that it has raised a round of financing from RRE, Spark, and our firm. I am joining the board along with Adam Ludwin from RRE.   You may wonder - how did we decide which mobile messaging startup to back? For us, it came down to the product and the team. The Kik product is simple, fast, and elegant. It gets the job done and doesn't get in the way. And the team, led by founder Ted Livingston, has a vision for how to package a lot of power and functionality into a simple, easy, and quick utility. We believe that less is more and that message delivery speed is paramount.   If you want to experience Kik yourself, please visit the download page and give it a try."
Innovation in Education,albertwenger,2011-03-07 19:52:13,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Today, President Obama will visit TechBoston Academy together with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Melinda Gates.  The President is likely to renew his call for more innovation in education, with initiatives such as the creation of a federal education research funding effort to be called ARPA-ED (modeled after DARPA).    At Union Square Ventures, we too are excited about the potential for innovation in education and have been for some time, dating back to our ""Hacking Education"" session two years ago.  Since then, we have continued to learn about how the Internet is disrupting traditional media and have met with many inspiring teams creating terrific new web services with the goal of doing the same in education.   Based on our learning from those meetings and from spending time with the team at Edmodo, where we invested this past fall, we have come up with three suggestions for accelerating innovation in education:  1. Empower Teachers to Adopt New Technologies
Teachers are on the frontline of education every day. There are many teachers who are early adopters of new technology in their personal lives. Giving teachers broader permission to use some of these new technologies in their classrooms will help to more rapidly bring innovation into the classroom. Often teachers won't even need money to do so, as some web services are entirely free to use for teachers (such as Edmodo) and others operate on a freemium model with meaningful free offers (e.g., Glogster). For paid services, teachers may be able to use DonorsChoose to fund their usage in the classroom. It would also be relatively easy to peer-produce a list of services and technologies that should be teacher adoptable.  2. Foster the Peer Production of Micro Chunked Creative Commons Content
That's a mouthful but each part of it has meaning. The Internet is a huge engine for the creation of content. Much of it may be trivial but there is also amazing new educational content created every day. Whether these are videos such as those recorded by Sal Khan or flash simulations created by a physics professor. Over time, these micro-chunks will fill more and more areas of learning and can be used by teachers in the classroom, by students directly, by adaptive learning systems, by lifelong learners. Having content in micro chunks makes it far easier to dynamically provide the right content to the right learner at the right moment than was previously possible with large monolithic blocks of content. Having much of it Creative Commons licensed means that it can be used freely for non-commercial purposes (which includes all public schools). Individuals creating such content should receive ample public recognition and the use of Creative Commons licensing should be encouraged.   3. Create Data through Engagement
There has been a longstanding desire to better and more scientifically understand what works and doesn't work in education.  Much of the research has been hampered by the difficulty of collecting the relevant data.  The same problem has been encountered in trying to better measure how students are progressing on a day-to-day basis and how teachers (and schools and districts) are performing.  Starting with expensive data collection systems usually does not work well, as teachers, students and administrators generally don't have the time or inclination for additional data entry tasks. Instead, we have to succeed in building systems that are fun to use and engage students and teachers alike.  Once we have a few systems like that in use at Internet scale, we will have plenty of ""data exhaust"" that will support many of the analyses we all would like to be able to conduct.  What all three of these suggestions have in common is that they are highly cost efficient.  They are aimed at unleashing the power of the Internet to let us all work together to innovate in education.  We would love to see them embraced at the federal, state and district levels."
Stack Overflow becomes Stack Exchange,BradUSV,2011-03-09 12:28:04,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We are thrilled to announce that Stack Overflow has closed a follow-on round of financing led by Index Ventures with participation from Spark Capital and ourselves. Neil Rimer  and Bijan Sabet  will join the board. We will also add a new independent director Anil Dash.   Stack Overflow has also changed its name to Stack Exchange to reflect growth of the Stack Exchange network. Though Stack Overflow the Q&A site for programmers is still by far the largest site, there are now more than 45 vertical sites building strong communities around, Cooking, Photography, Statistics, Math, Game Development, Physics, English, and more.   The Stack Exchange network gets almost 20 million unique monthly visitors, and the new Stack Exchange network sites have more than double their traffic since the end of last year. Perhaps most exciting Stack Overflow, the flagship site,  has developed a native business model that seamlessly creates value for sponsors and users. Careers 2.0 is a great way for companies to find talented programmers and and a great way for talented programmers to find great projects to work on.  You can read more about the financing and Stack Exchange's plans for the money on their blog. "
Kickstarter,fredwilson,2011-03-17 16:57:41,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"In the fall of 2009, we met the founding team at Kickstarter. Perry, Yancey, and Charles had built a marketplace where anyone could fund and follow creativity of all kinds. We were immediately taken with the team and the idea.  We are all well aware of what is happening to the existing models for funding creative ideas. But what we have not seen enough of, yet, are new models to replace them. Creative people will continue to produce amazing works. We do not think technology and the Internet will change that, other than possibly to accelerate the rate of creativity. But how will these creators get the funding to produce the work and put food on their tables and roofs over their heads? That is an open question and one we are very interested in helping to answer.  We believe that Kickstarter is a very important and fundamental idea that will most certainly be part of the answer. Simply put, Kickstarter allows everyone to fund the projects they want to see come to fruition. The creators set the amount of funding they need and the marketplace determines whether the project is worthy of funding.   When we made the investment, it was decided that we'd keep it quiet for a while. We never had a great reason to change that posture. And so we ended up keeping it quiet for over a year. Recently the company has been getting a lot of attention and it has become clear to all of us that the quiet period is over. So now we get to add the Kickstarter logo to our investments page and we can talk about the company publicly as much as we talk about it privately. We are all looking forward to doing that. "
Canvas,fredwilson,2011-06-13 08:59:15,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"We are big fans of communities at Union Square Ventures. The partners in our firm have been investing in Internet communities for almost 15 years and we are constantly reminded of the power of the community. Whenever we are presented with the opportunity to invest in an emerging new Internet community, we take it very seriously.  We were presented with exactly that opportunity a few months ago by Chris Poole, also known on the Internet as ""moot."" When Chris was 15 years old he launched one of the most powerful Internet communities, 4chan, from his bedroom. For eight years, Chris has been operating, moderating, building, observing, and learning from 4chan. Last year, Chris recruited a small group of engineers and designers and started building a new Internet community called Canvas.  Canvas is a real-time canvas on the Internet. It is a community where everyone can come to create imagery together. It is inspired by the best of 4chan but is aimed at much more. At the heart of Canvas is the concept of remixing. Every image on Canvas has a remix button which allows users to quickly modify the image and repost it. The result are threads that are anchored by the initial image. Here are a few of my favorite examples:  Ze Frank Scribbler  Charlie Sheen - I Probably Took More  All The Things?  Redrawn Icons  4chan is famously anonymous. It is raucous, unruly, and tremendously creative. The architecture of Canvas is subtly different, and although anonymous posting is allowed, you must first register a login to participate.   There aren't any filters on Canvas. You see what is happening there in real-time. Sometimes the result is inspiring. Sometimes the result is provocative. I liken it to real world creative communities like the Lower East Side of NYC when I arrived here in the early 80s. The most interesting creativity comes from places that aren't always manicured and sterile.  Canvas is very much a work in progress. The service is still in invite-only beta and requires you connect with Facebook to register. Chris and the Canvas team are committed to building the most exciting and interesting community for real-time creativity on the Internet, and we are thrilled to be along for the ride. You can get on the ride as well because Canvas is hiring. Their jobs page is here."
The PROTECT IP Act Will Slow Start-up Innovation,BradUSV,2011-06-23 12:25:12,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"As venture capitalists, we believe deeply in the value of decentralized, emergent, start-up innovation. The Internet has been an unusually fertile ground for this type of innovation largely because, for the first time in history, it has been possible to get directly to consumers without negotiating with entrenched intermediaries. The result has been a spectacular explosion of innovation with tremendous benefits to consumers and to the global economy.  McKinsey recently studied thirteen mature national economies and found that over the past five years, 21% of GDP growth can be directly attributed to the Internet. They found that 2.4 jobs were created for every job lost to Internet efficiencies. They also found that over the last fifteen years, an increase in Internet maturity is directly correlated to an average increase in real per capita GDP of $500. By contrast, it took 50 years to see that impact during the industrial revolution of the 19th century.  The Internet is good for the economy. It is also good for consumers. McKinsey found that Internet efficiencies put $64B back in U.S. consumer's pockets in 2009. The full report is here.  So when considering legislation or regulation that would impact the basic structure of the Internet, we believe that legislators and regulators should be guided by a key tenet of the Hippocratic Oath ""FIRST DO NO HARM"".   Earlier today, together with fifty-three venture capitalists from forty firms, we sent a letter to one hundred Senators and a number of Congressman expressing our concern about S. 968, the PROTECT IP Act (""PIPA""). We believe this act, as it is currently written, does not meet this critical test.   The entire letter is available here, but a key section is quoted below:  The bill is ripe for abuse, as it allows rights-holders to require third-parties to block access to and take away revenues sources for online services, with limited oversight and due process.

In particular: 

	By requiring ""information location tools"" -- potentially encompassing any ""director[ies], index[es], reference[s], pointer[s], or hypertext link[s]"" -- to remove access to entire domains, the bill puts burdens on countless Internet services.
	By requiring access to sites to be blocked by Domain Name System providers, it endangers the security and integrity of the Internet.
	The bill's private right of action will no doubt be used by many rights-holders in ways that create significant burdens on legitimate online commerce services. The scope of orders and cost of litigation could be significant, even for companies acting in good faith.
  From our perspective as investors, this will substantially increase the risk of investing in an already risky sector. These risks will necessarily reduce the availability of capital for young companies. That could have a serious impact on venture backed start-ups and reduce the number of innovative services available to consumers.   Even worse, we believe the legislation will not make a serious dent on piracy. But it's unintended consequences will diminish the United States role as a leader in one of the most important and promising sectors of the global economy.  Again from our letter:  While we understand PIPA was originally intended to deal with ""rogue"" foreign sites, we think PIPA will ultimately put American innovators and investors at a clear disadvantage in the global economy. For one, services dedicated to infringement will simply make their sites easy to find and access in other ways, and determined users who want to find blocked content will simply shift to services outside the reach of U.S. law, in turn giving a leg up to foreign search engines, DNS providers, social networks, and others. Second, PIPA creates a dangerous precedent and a convenient excuse for countries to engage in protectionism and censorship against U.S. services.  Venture capitalists are notoriously apolitical. We believe in markets. We are not asking for tax breaks or favorable regulatory rulings, we are asking for restraint.   The group of venture capitalists who joined us in expressing concern about S. 968, the PROTECT IP Act (""PIPA"") represent a broad range of political views. We share a passion for start-ups and a conviction that young companies are a fantastic source of productive innovation. This group is responsible for a significant amount of investment in the U.S. economy.   The signatories to this letter work for firms that manage over $13B. We are early investors in services like Facebook, Twitter, Zynga, Skype, Groupon, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Foursquare, and a host of other important web services. The services we have backed now reach over a billion users.   We believe that policy makers understand the importance of this sector of our economy. We hope they will address our concerns.

Lending Club,johnbuttrick,2011-08-03 10:59:34,1,0,[u'johnbuttrick'],"Have you ever wondered why a bank charges an 18+% interest rate on credit card balances (regardless of credit history), but only pays depositors 1% on their balance? These are fantastic economics for bank management and bank stockholders, but not for borrowers or depositors. We believe it is a market inefficiency ripe for innovation and disruption.  Renaud Laplanche noticed this inefficiency and in 2006 he founded Lending Club. Lending Club is the leading Internet marketplace for lenders and borrowers and expects to originate over $300mm in loans this fiscal year. The company is growing rapidly and it will not be long before Lending Club is originating more than $1bn in loans annually.  While Lending Club offers personal loans to people with a variety of borrowing needs, its primary class of borrowers are credit-worthy consumers who were paying high interest rates on credit card balances. The Lending Club platform allows consumers to refinance their debt with lower interest rates and offers investors direct access to these high quality borrowers. The company has built a sophisticated risk model and offers excellent risk-adjusted returns, currently in the range of 6-12%. If you are an investor, you should take a look.   Lending Club has built a terrific business and we are excited to announce that our Opportunity Fund has led a $25 million Series D financing round. This is the first Opportunity Fund investment in a company in which USV was not an early investor.   One of the many great things about Lending Club is the company's transparency. The website offers easy-to-understand information about the lending platform, credit risk and default rates. Moreover, in early 2008 Renaud made the tough decision to register its borrower notes with the SEC. As a result, Lending Club files public company reports and prospectuses. You can learn a lot more about the company here.   Renaud has built a superb senior management team and we have no doubt that Lending Club is at an inflection point. We're excited to be an investor.

Skillshare,albertwenger,2011-08-16 09:55:07,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"The Internet has been an amazing platform for creating and distributing educational content.  Khan Academy has become the canonical example cited here but terrific free content is emerging from many different sources such as the Open Courseware initiative and even Youtube.  Free content was a major theme at our Hacking Education event a couple of years back and has only accelerated since.  As a result, it will be possible to learn almost anything from materials found online.  But there is a big missing link and that is motivation.  It is the desire to want to learn something in the first place. Instilling that desire is still best accomplished in person by a teacher who is passionate about his or her subject.  Here too the Internet provides a unique new opportunity.  In addition to teachers at schools and universities there are many more people who are knowledgeable and passionate about a wide variety of subjects.   This is where Skillshare comes in.  Skillshare is ""a community marketplace for offline classes"" and the company's motto is ""learn anything from anyone.""  Skillshare lets everyone who is passionate set up a class and find students.  As it turns out, one of the subjects I am passionate about is the importance of understanding probability and how it should be considered in all our decision making.  My class on Skillshare now has over 90 watchers and I thoroughly enjoyed teaching the class last week for the first time. I plan to to repeat teaching this and related classes at least once a quarter.  Christina and Eric Friedman have taught a class on finding a job at a startup.  Fred is announcing today that he will be taking MBA Mondays and teaching a Skillshare class based on that which I expect to be wildly popular. In the meantime, there are already many other terrific classes to explore.  We are excited to be investing in Skillshare together with Spark Capital and joining a terrific group of seed investors.  We look forward to working with Michael, Malcolm and the team at Skillshare in unleashing the teachers within all of us.  Or as the Skillshare team puts their vision: ""Let's transform every community into a campus, every address into a classroom and every neighbor into a teacher and student."""
Jig - When You Need A Little Help,albertwenger,2011-09-06 06:59:20,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"When we first announced our investment in what was then called Tasty Labs we provided no indication as to what the team was building.  That's because they were just getting going on a problem that Joshua had been thinking about for quite some time - how to use the web to get help with a need.  What is a need? Merriam Webster defines it as ""a lack of something requisite, desirable, or useful.""  If that strikes you as diffuse that's a good thing -- because needs generally aren't well defined questions with definitive answers.  For those, the web together with search provides a pretty good solution.  Instead in every day life when we approach someone and say ""I need ..."" it tends to be more complicated than a single query.  We may not have the time to look through many results and compare them.  Or we lack the background to evaluate the information we find.  Or we simply want someone else to make a choice for us (preferably among a bunch of alternatives that could all meet our need).  That's where jig comes in.  It is a service for getting help from friends, followers and even strangers in addressing needs.  One way to think about jig is as a formalization of the lazy web. The #lazyweb tag has become quite popular on Twitter but as a broad horizontal service Twitter itself lacks many of the specific features that one would like to see around asking for and receiving help.    As for building those features, the jig team is taking a highly iterative approach to building and improving the service.  Jig has been live for weeks and anyone who went to the site could sign up and start to participate.  Rather than anticipating every possible way people might want to use (or for that matter abuse) the service, the team is studying actual patterns and then working to modify those.  So expect jig to change quite a bit over the coming weeks and months.  In the meantime, head on over there and post a need or help a friend or stranger with theirs."
Wattpad,albertwenger,2011-09-12 06:50:44,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Stories have been with us probably as long as language has, and the need for stories appears deeply rooted in all of us.  We have come a long way from quite literally sitting around a fire to sophisticated technologies such as video games and 3D movies.  Yet even now it is not the technology that moves us but the stories.  In fact for a long period of time, technology both helped and hurt story telling.  On one hand, new technologies such as the printed book allowed authors to reach a larger audience.  On the other hand, these technologies were costly and required intermediaries, such as publishers, record labels, TV and movie studios, and so on.  The Internet as the latest technology, however, has removed that barrier.  With it story tellers can both reach the largest possible audience and can do so without intermediaries.  While they can do so using blogs and web sites those aren't ideally suited to stories (e.g., blogs tend to run backwards) and don't form a larger community dedicated to stories as each author has to build their own community.  Wattpad is a community for telling and reading stories.  Collectively, Wattpad users last quarter spent an amazing 2 billion minutes writing and reading stories on Wattpad.  During that time, nearly three quarter million new stories or parts of stories were uploaded and writers received almost five million comments.  To learn more about how Wattpad works you may want to watch this explanatory video.  At present I am reading a science fiction story called M.A.I.D.S, which was written by Wattpad user MACThree, who according to his profile is a former pro-wrestler.  I will definitely leave a comment for MACThree once I have finished.  In the meantime, I have several other science fiction stories already downloaded to my phone.  We are excited to be backing founders Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen and the team in growing the Wattpad community.  We are joining the existing and new angel investors and Golden Venture Partners out of Toronto, which is Wattpad's home base.  In addition to more writers and readers, Wattpad is also looking for engineers and designers."
Wattpad's Continued Re-Imagining of the Book,albertwenger,2012-06-06 09:29:33,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"This week is Book Expo America which is the biggest book trade show in the US. That's a great moment for reflecting on how the book is being transformed in the age of the Internet. Mary Meeker in her slide deck chose to symbolize what she called the ""re-imagining"" of the book with a Kindle. But the Kindle is still primarily a carrier for traditionally written and published books. We are excited about the re-imagining of books happening on Wattpad, a USV portfolio company.  Wattpad has a rapidly growing community of readers and writers. To date 5 million user-written stories have been posted on Wattpad in 25 languages. Last month alone people spent 1.7 billion minutes reading on Wattpad! Most of this is happening via mobile but more importantly it is happening outside the traditional publishing cycles. Given this tremendous growth, we are excited that Khosla Ventures has just led a new round of financing for Wattpad. You can read more about Wattpad's growth, vision and the funding on the company's blog. Congratulations to the Wattpad team!  "
Turntable,fredwilson,2011-09-13 10:38:33,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Sometimes you end up loving something you don't want to. When turntable.fm launched, I wanted to avoid it. There was the Facebook login button that I didn't want to use. There was another music service I didn't want to add to my already-exhaustive collection. And then there was the matter of Seth and Billy, who may have the distinction of getting more ""no thanks"" from me than any other pair of entrepreneurs in the world. Seth got the first one from me in 1996 I believe, and they got the most recent one from me less than a year ago.  But the service kept coming after me. It was showing up in my twitter stream, my facebook feed, my tumblr dashboard. My friends were on it and loving it. Our office was on it and loving it.   So one day in late June or early July, I finally hit that Facebook login and took a tour of turntable. What I found was people, lots of them, they were playing music, they were listening to music, they were talking to each other, they were dancing, they were having fun. And I was too. I was sold in about five minutes. I called up Seth and Billy and said ""let's talk.""  One of the worst kept secrets in startupland is that Union Square Ventures has led a round of financing for turntable.fm. We've been joined in this financing by Polaris, First Round and Chris Sacca and will also be joined by a collection of strategic angels who will close later this month. Billy has the news up on the turntable blog.  Billy Chasen is one of the most talented web entrepreneurs I've met. He makes software that looks different, feels different, and is different. His Chartbeat service is the most elegant and beautiful analytics product ever created. I've wanted to work with Billy for years. But we never found the right project to work together on. Now we have. I'm very excited about that.  Seth Goldstein is one of the first web entrepreneurs I ever met, back in NYC in the mid 90s. I've been his friend since, and we were colleagues at Flatiron where Seth built a killer mobile web portfolio a decade before its time. We both learned a lot from that. I've been trying to work with Seth again for a decade and now it has happened. A homecoming of sorts.  But the thing that has made all of this is possible is turntable.fm. I'm in the service now as I'm writing this, in my regular early morning hang, the indie while you work room. You'll find me there most mornings between 5am and 7am eastern. If you like to listen to indie music while you work, and if you are an early riser like me, maybe we can listen to some music together, chat about whatever, and maybe even jump on the stage and spin some tracks.   It is this form of socializing together across physical distance that makes the web special. As Dave Weinberger said,   On the Web, however, strangers are the source of everything worthwhile. Strangers and their utterances are the stuff of the Web. They are what give the Web its matter, its shape, its value.  Turntable is where strangers play music they love to each other, talk, and in time become friends. It happens to me most mornings and it is a special experience and I'd encourage you to experience it yourself."
We're hiring,christinacaci,2011-09-28 18:16:44,1,0,[u'christinacaci'],"Union Square Ventures has a long history - in internet time at least - of hiring off this blog (posts here, here, and here.) A fundamental assumption of the way we've hired is that we're able to get to know great people through their ""web presence"" - the trail of online communities, projects, and services with which they've engaged.   Just as we invest in the transformative power of the internet, we're also looking to build our organization off the internet - plus, we've met some really impressive folks through this blog. And so, in this vein, I'm excited to announce that USV is hiring an investment analyst.  The analyst position at Union Square Ventures is a two-year role designed for someone who doesn't have an MBA. As an analyst at USV, you'll learn what the venture capital business is about, and you'll get insight into a handful of fascinating startups too. We hope that, after working with us, this person will move on to a startup or another venture firm or pursue an advanced degree.  The primary responsibility of the analyst is to help manage the day-to-day activities of the firm, including: 

	Meeting with entrepreneurs who have started businesses in which USV may be interested in investing
	Performing market research and due diligence for potential investments, which could entail financial or web-analytics modeling, interviewing customers/users or potential customers/users, or testing products and services
	Reporting for our investors, which includes helping to set companies' valuations, writing quarterly updates, and packaging the material for our LPs
	Working with USV portfolio companies, including helping out with hiring, events-planning, and research and attending board meetings
	Designing and executing projects of your own direction that help USV and/or our portfolio companies
  We're looking for someone who demonstrates:

	Deep understanding of the ecosystem of web and mobile services
	Strong written and oral communication skills - well-defended opinions are a necessity
	Familiarity with web technologies - you know the difference between the LAMP stack and a stack of lamps
	Strong interpersonal skills - you'll often be talking to entrepreneurs and other investors on behalf of USV
	Comfort modeling in Excel
	Ideally, prior design or programming experience or work in an investment or internet-related position
  Our office is in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, and the job starts immediately. We're a small team, and we'll be looking for someone who fits our culture. Culture's a tricky thing to describe well, so we encourage you to check out our web presences.  If you're interested in the position, please reach out:  First, we're looking to see links that will help us get to know you. This could be anything from a Twitter account to a blog or Tumblr to a project you hacked together - whatever represents you best. We expect your web presence to represent who you are, not who you think an employer wishes you were, so please don't waste time sanitizing your web presence before sending us there. We get it.  Second, we'd also like to hear from you, so we're asking each applicant to record two short videos answering these questions: ""Why are you interested in the analyst role at Union Square Ventures?"" (up to a 90-second response) and ""Which web or mobile services most inspire you?"" (up to a 120-second response) We're using Take The Interview to collect the video responses securely.  To apply, visit Take The Interview. None of the information you submit will be shared outside of USV. We'll be accepting applicants until 6pm Eastern time on Thursday, October 13.  If you have questions, please leave them in the comments below. Otherwise, we're looking forward to hearing about what you find compelling, what you've made, how you think, and why you're into what we do."

Duck Duck Go,BradUSV,2011-10-13 10:08:59,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"When I first got into the venture capital business in the early 90s, it seemed to me that half of the deals I brought to the partnership were dismissed with the line ""sure it's cool but what the heck do they do if Microsoft decides to enter this business."" Today the role of the dominant player is played by Google (and increasingly Facebook). So as an investor, one has to consider how a potential portfolio company can thrive in the shadow of Google. No where is this more true than in Search.  So, as you can imagine, we had a lot of interesting conversations in the process of evaluating our latest investment in Gabriel Weinberg's alternative search engine, DuckDuckGo. Our confidence in Gabriel and DuckDuckGo is informed by having watched the decline of Microsoft's hegemony in the 90's. Two things happened that fundamentally changed the game: a shift in venue and a shift in business model. The venue moved from the desktop to the web and the business model shifted from packaged software to open source. It turned out that the way to compete with Microsoft was to not to compete, at least not directly. The way to compete with Microsoft was to change the basis of competition. We invested in DuckDuckGo because we became convinced that it was not only possible to change the basis of competition in search, it was time to do it.   I remember clearly when a friend first pointed me to Google, it was a revelation. Using it was a palpably better experience. As part of the process of evaluating DuckDuckGo, several of us switched our default search engines in Chrome (there's simple how-to instructions below the search box on DuckDuckGo's homepage), and had a similar ""ah ha"" moment. The company is young and under staffed so there are definitely holes Gabriel hopes to fill, but his observation that ""traditional algorithmic signals are not the only authority on the web,"" and his clever use of real authorities to curate search results makes Duck Duck Go an interesting alternative to your everyday brand.  We are thrilled to be working with Gabriel. He is exactly the kind of entrepreneur we like to back. He has built and sold companies before. Over the last few years, he has patiently bootstrapped Duck Duck Go into a viable search engine without taking a penny of outside capital. Please join us in welcoming Duck Duck Go and Gabriel Weinberg to the Union Square Ventures portfolio."
My Back Pages,aweissman,2011-10-20 08:47:08,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"For many years, I have been a reader of this blog.  I'm excited, and humbled, by the opportunity to now be a contributor and to announce here that I have joined Union Square Ventures.
 
In early 2007, when I joined up with John Borthwick and began discussing something that would later be called betaworks, we spent hours talking about how the next phase of Internet growth - that was social at its core and operated in real time - would change every way users experienced and distributed media and content.  So, we built a business that focused on end-user participation, data openness, two-way content creation, community and connectedness.  John had the foresight to understand how meaningful these concepts would become and how to translate them into some awesome products.
 
Now as part of USV I'm working with an amazing and diverse group of people who are dedicated to transparency in thinking, open dialogue and deliberation as process principles, and a belief in the power of networks created by the Internet.  USV's goal is to find and support people and companies with that same set of principles.
 
The USV ""thesis"" is remarkably similar to that of betaworks, only reduced to a more appropriate 140 characters.  Given that overlap, we co-invested with USV numerous times over the years, from Tumblr to Outside.in to Kickstarter and more.
 
My friend Nina Khosla once told me that when thinking about the web, she gets most excited not by the services that offer the greatest utility but by those that create meaning for users.  She writes: ""What web product last made you cry as you used it? What web product makes you laugh on a regular basis? What web product brings you new friends? What web product makes your other friends closer? What web product creates new interests for you? What web product allows you to actualize on your passions?""
 
I've been lucky to have built and supported a few services that answered her questions.  Now it's time to find some more."
Codecademy,aweissman,2011-10-23 16:50:29,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"A few weeks back, Ryan Bubinski, who co-founded Codecademy with Zach Sims, said to me that he thought learning how to code should be a fundamental skill on par with learning how to read or write or do arithmetic.  And, that the Internet was the ideal platform to create the largest community learning to program.  So it's no surprise that Ryan and Zach built a service explicitly designed to be ""the easiest way to learn how to code.""  Indeed, a few days after I had this conversation with Ryan, I watched my 12 year old daughter complete, in real time and in small bites, 3 lessons on Codecademy (Getting to Know You, Confirm or Deny and Variables).  More than 500,000 other people have also taken millions of mini-lessons since the service was launched in August.  Union Square Ventures is excited to make an investment in Codecademy as part of the company's Series A financing and support Zach and Ryan's vision of creating a platform where learning how to code is simple and can be shared.  Over the past few years, we've watched the Internet become a richer platform to learn and collaborate in new and different ways from new and different sources.  Free and inexpensive content increases the variety of sources from which people can learn online.  At the same time, as technology becomes the driving force in our economy, the ability to program and understand programming is becoming more important.  Codecademy is at the heart of a new and emerging programming information ""stack,"" which includes networks such as Stack Overflow (part of the Stack Exchange network) - ""Q&A for professional and enthusiast programmers"" - and Github - a platform for the collaborative development of software.    The collaborative nature of the internet has transformed other industries, yet we've only begun to see its impact on learning.  Codecademy currently taps into its community by offering users the ability to ""help create new lessons"" on the service.  Albert Wenger created a course - Functions in Javascript.   Ryan and Zach understand the importance of developing and listening to the communities that emerge around great web services.  It's no surprise then that writer Douglas Rushkoff's latest book is titled Program or be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age.   In it he writes:  When human beings acquired language, we learned not just how to listen but how to speak. When we gained literacy, we learned not just how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them.  In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It's really that simple: Program, or be programmed.  We are thrilled to support Zach and Ryan's goal of ""teaching the world to code."""

Help Protect Internet Innovation,albertwenger,2011-11-16 09:13:06,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"We have previously written about why the Protect IP Act (PIPA) is bad for innovation.  The same is true of the House version of this bill which is called the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).  In fact, SOPA goes beyond PIPA in several important ways.  For instance, SOPA contains anti-circumvention language that would essentially allow for government control over essential privacy software such as VPNs, proxies, and even something as fundamental as SSH.  SOPA also provides for an incredibly broad right of private action that would allow content owners to interfere with the operations of payment processors and social media services such as Twitter.  For those who doubt the chilling impact on innovation, there is a brand new study by Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner showing that investment in cloud startups increased as much as $1 billion after a court ruling that permitted cloud-based DVRs (which content companies had previously opposed).  Innovation on the Internet has been enabled by key organizing principles behind the design of the Internet, including the separation of different layers and the open architecture.  Vint Cerf, who together with Bob Kahn, was responsible for much of the initial design of the Internet has warned that the government is ""beginning to go overboard in the protection of copyright"" which will harm innovation.   Today is the beginning of hearings on SOPA. The Judiciary Committe has apparently chosen to hear from five people supporting SOPA and only one opposing comment.  This is not for a lack of trying on behalf of technology companies. Several weeks ago Netcoalition, which represents Internet firms including Google, Amazon, eBay, IAC, Yahoo and PayPal, asked to be heard at the hearings but has been specifically excluded from testifying against SOPA.  As Fred has pointed out this is very different from the process that resulted in the passing of the DMCA which currently governs the relationship between copyright holders and technology companies and would essentially be superseded by SOPA.   Given this imbalance in front of the Committee, it is essential that lawmakers hear from as many Internet entrepreneurs, employees and investors as possible.  Some of the largest companies on the Internet, including Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Zynga and Twitter have all signed up to a letter expressing their opposition to the bills as currently drafted.  The Protect Innovation site makes it possible to support this petition by easily sending a note to legislators.  We encourage everyone to sign it.  Going one step further, we have also decided to add a ""Stop Censorship"" graphic to our site that overlaps our logo.  This indicates our belief that the bills as currently drafted don't just inhibit innovation but unreasonably restrict freedom of speech.  SOPA comes close to establishing the American equivalent of the Chinese firewall (just lacks IP filtering) and undermines the freedom to post links which is essential to free speech on the Internet, including blogs and Twitter.  We are not alone in this belief as this letter signed by over 50 law professors against an earlier version of the bill shows.

What comes next,christinacaci,2011-11-28 09:03:38,1,0,[u'christinacaci'],"Now is a great time to be an internet entrepreneur. While much of the global economy sputters, tech companies post growth numbers other industries haven't seen in years. Their success hasn't gone unnoticed, and the pace of tech-company creation has quickened.   There's more than me-tooism going on. It is, for example, easier to start a tech company than ever before - it's easier to access startup capital, procure basic infrastructure and tools at lower prices, find and cultivate mentors, and join an accelerator program.   Accelerator programs that focus on early-stage technology companies have grabbed headlines recently. The programs are designed to be crash courses in starting a technology company and bringing a product to market. They often last three intense months, ending with a structured pitch to a roomful of investors. The most famous program is Y Combinator, based in Silicon Valley, but there are other programs around the world, including Techstars, 500 Startups, DreamIt, Excelerate, and Seedcamp.  Over the past few months, I've seen over 160 companies come through eight different accelerator programs. It's a skewed group, but it captures the zeitgeist of a certain segment of the tech industry - and, I think, looking at these companies is one of the best ways to get a sense for which opportunities compel internet entrepreneurs today. Here's a look at some of what these entrepreneurs are thinking about - and where we all might be headed:  Software is developing its own component industry
Last year, John Maeda predicted technology would become a cottage industry by 2020 ""with bespoke applications made by many, rather than today's industrialized, Microsoft-esque mass production and distribution model."" I doubt we've seen the last billion-dollar software company; tech companies will continue to ride the economics of software, and larger companies will use strong network effects and scale to drive consolidation. However, we'll likely see fewer companies that need to build - and fewer companies that will build - every piece of their technology themselves.  Component sourcing has already begun to revolutionize the software industry. Take a look at Amazon's or Rackspace's cloud hosting services, which have lowered the price and complexity of hosting software, or the success of ""outsourced"" tools like Google Analytics, Twilio's voice and text messaging infrastructure, or Urban Airship's iOS notifications.  Entrepreneurs in this summer's accelerator programs sliced off pieces of what it takes to build and run a web or mobile application and offered those slices as services. ""I built this piece of technology three times at three different companies. I built it a fourth time, and that's the service my company offers,"" a Y Combinator CEO pitched.  Developers are the target customer for 30% of the companies I saw. Consider Parse, which provides a backend to a mobile app, and MongoHQ, which hosts instances of the open-source MongoDB. While LaunchRock offers user acquisition tools, TightDB provides a database customized for big data. ReportGrid provides website analytics, while CoderBuddy helps developers create and host websites on Google's App Engine, and Creative Brain Studios allows game developers to deploy one game on several devices and operating systems.   Using components to build larger systems doesn't require building monotonous systems. Consider the iPhone, made of component parts sourced from Chinese megafactories but designed in California. There's something beautiful and unique about the iPhone that no other handset manufacturer has been able to match - even the ones that source parts from the same megafactories.  Similar to physical-product designers, when software developers start with components, they can concentrate on the core problem they're solving and will create better products in less time. It's exciting.  Work is shifting toward a peer-to-peer model
The first two decades of the modern internet broke industries built on distribution monopolies (e.g. music, news) and facilitated coordination between the consumer and the provider without the need for a middleman (e.g. hotels, car rentals.) The same will happen for a large fraction of our work, especially in cases where the work is standardized or employers ""distribute"" their workers to pools of customers.  One reason to create firms is the coordination and signaling problems of situations with imperfect information and transaction costs. As technology increases information flows and decreases transaction costs, individuals can leave their old employers and strike out on their own. Their livelihoods will still depend on providing valuable services in exchange for fees, but they'll do so as freelancers - and on their own, they'll capture more of the value generated by their work.  Just as blogs allowed talented writers to build audiences without being affiliated with large media organizations, and as Twitter and Tumblr allowed news- and tastemakers to succeed outside of established news or media properties, new web services will allow individuals to engage with customers without needing to work for a firm.  These free agents, disaggregated and newly empowered, can promote and sustain themselves with new tools: Opez caters to service professionals, like bartenders and hairdressers, and allows them to build followings independent of their employers, while Vayable and SideTour provide marketing and transaction-processing for neighborhood tour guides. Hiptic helps graphic designers promote their work, while Zerply helps creative professionals do the same, and InterviewStreet lets programmers show off their skills.  As technology creates new free agents, it's also changing the notion of ""work"" to be less time- and location-specific. This is especially true of work that can be done easily at a distance. Workers who can't differentiate themselves using their reputation will be commoditized. This summer, web services were launched that allow you to order up a proofreader (Kibin), blogger (Contently), tutor (LearnBop), language partner (Verbling), car ride (Ridejoy), science researcher (Science Exchange), cooking instructor (Culture Kitchen), mystery shopper (SpotCheck), or transcriptionist (Mobile Works) from your browser. The Mechanical Turkification of work has begun.  Between identified, liberated individuals and the nameless, faceless drones of Mechanical Turk lies identity: does it matter who performs the task at hand? If the worker's background, skills, or experience matter, there's likely to be higher variance in demand for a particular person's services, and free agents will be sought after and chosen by reputation on services built for those purposes. Less-skilled people are likely better suited for tasks for which identity doesn't matter, and other marketplaces that don't include a concept of reputation will provide access to a global pool of workers.  What's really next
Looking at activity across accelerator programs, it's not clear which ""one thing"" will be next. This season's 160 ""accelerated"" companies, nevermind other tech companies created outside of incubators, each seek to solve different problems and should be understood individually. (Making tricky, admittedly, sweeping essays like this one.)   Yet broader shifts like the componentization of some software development and a shift from employed workers to independent agents have begun to emerge; other shifts will become more apparent with time. These, plus the overall pace of tech-company creation, give me faith we haven't seen anything yet."
Dwolla,albertwenger,2012-02-06 19:53:51,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Money is one of the fundamental underpinnings of the economy, yet we largely take it for granted.  When we pay for our morning cup of coffee (or tea) with cash or a credit card, we tend not to stop and marvel at what just happened.  Someone gave us a delicious steaming hot beverage - clearly something of value - for either a worn piece of paper or for some information from the swipe of a card - neither of any immediate value. Once you start to think about it that way, you realize what an amazing innovation money actually is compared to having to figure out what thing of immediate value you could barter for your beverage (a backrub?).  Money itself is a surprisingly old innovation, going back thousands of years.  Along the way there have been three critical breakthroughs. First, a high degree of standardization -- all of the US and even some far away places (e.g. Ecuador) use the US dollar.  Similarly, all other countries use easily recognizable coins and bills as ""tokens."" Second, the tokens used as money are no longer something that is of any intrinsic value and they are no longer guaranteed by the government to be exchangeable into something of scarcity (e.g., gold).  Money tokens are valuable only in the context of a payment transaction. Third, we came up with the extension of credit and fractional reserve banking. In combination, the two have allowed us to grow economies that are much larger than the number of available physical currency tokens would permit.  Now we find ourselves at the beginning of yet another important innovation in money: the complete disappearance of physical money tokens. We are moving towards a world in which money consists solely of data that is kept someplace in the network.  When we pay someone in that world all we are really doing is causing some data to move around.  The shift from the physical to the virtual raises a number of exciting possibilities for the future of money including the rise of reputation currencies.  One thing should be true in a world of data-as-money: payments initiated by a known party that do not involve an extension of credit should be (almost) free at the margin.  When you hand someone cash today, no one comes up and takes a portion as a fee.  Similarly, if you use data representing your money to pay for your coffee that should essentially be free of fees.  That is the premise behind Dwolla, and we are excited to be backing the Dwolla team on their quest to dramatically change how payments work.  You can learn a lot more about everything that they are working on from the Dwolla blog or just go ahead and sign up."
The Freedom to Innovate,BradUSV,2012-03-14 12:36:25,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Last night, I had the honor of speaking at the Center For Democracy and Technology's 2012 Annual Dinner.    Here is what I shared with the audience:  I started working in technology 30 years ago and for most of that time thought that the work I did had very little to do with policy. Back then, I was either building or investing in the technology infrastructure that became the foundation for the Internet.  In the last several years, however, the investment opportunity has shifted from infrastructure to the applications and services that ride on top of that infrastructure. All of a sudden, every policy decision made in Washington impacts our work. Many impinge on what I believe is a core freedom: the freedom to innovate.   I want to spend a few minutes tonight sharing my view of how that happened, and what it means to our economy and our society going forward.  At Union Square Ventures we invest in networks. We were the first institutional investor in Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare, Etsy, and Kickstarter. We have also invested in many other less familiar networks in markets like education, employment, and finance.  As we spend time with these networks, we learn more and more about their extraordinary economics. They are easy to bootstrap, create remarkable efficiencies, optimize the value of scarce resources, and cost very little to promote.   Like most of these networks, Foursquare was built on open source software and its services are delivered over the Internet. They were able to grow to over 100,000 users on less than $25,000.  Craigslist radically reduced the cost of classified advertising. They replaced the call centers, printing presses, trucks and trees that used to be necessary to alert the world that you wanted to sell your couch--with a digital photo and a drop-dead simple electronic posting mechanism. Airbnb has re-invented the way travelers are matched with beds, and in the process enabled hundreds of thousands of people around the world to capture the value in their spare bedroom.   Twitter, Tumblr and Foursquare spend little or nothing to acquire new users or to propagate a new feature. We hear a lot about viral marketing but I did not internalize its implications until I watched David Karp, the founder of Tumblr, introduce a new feature: by hiding it.   When I was an entrepreneur in the software business we spent a ton of money and time to introduce a new feature. We did analyst tours, issued press releases, threw parties, and bought billboards to promote a new feature. David hides it. But then he sends an email to a few popular bloggers and tells them if they mouse over this one section of the site, they will see a drop down menu with a couple of new capabilities. He encourages them to play with the features but asks them not to tell too many people about it because he is not committed to releasing it generally.   So they use the features and of course someone reading their blog sees they have done something cool and asks how they did it. Two weeks later there is a kid in Akron, Ohio, telling a kid down the street, ""I am not really supposed to tell you this but if you mouse over this part of the site..."" and the feature is now ubiquitous.  These economics create enormous opportunity. The combination of low costs, cheap capital and relatively free access to markets has created an unprecedented era of decentralized, emergent, start-up innovation. By creating novel new services and dramatically reducing the cost of existing services, that innovation has unlocked value for consumers, that they are now redeploying in other new services.   But at the same time, that process, the classic creative destruction of free market capitalism, has created new challenges for incumbent industrial companies.   For the last 130 years the economy has been dominated by firms structured as bureaucratic hierarchies. That model worked well to mass produce products for mass consumption, but the inefficiency of communicating customer needs up through the hierarchy and management decisions back down, and the natural tendency of any organization to protect its current organization structure makes it difficult if not impossible for bureaucratic hierarchies to innovate as quickly as the emerging network-based model of decentralized innovation.  So the incumbents who have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to maximize profits look for ways to stave off competition from networks and protect their current cost structures. Increasingly, they ask policy makers and regulators to change the rules in ways that tilt the market in their favor.   Policy makers and regulators who have long standing relationships with these incumbents are receptive to these requests because they are usually couched in language about the safety or security of consumers, and because there are only a few people--most of whom are in this room--who are explaining the risks of these proposed policies and regulations.   Over the next few years there will be a steady stream of these requests. The hotel lobby in New York City has already convinced the city council to outlaw temporary hotels. The bill was presented as a consumer safety measure to prevent slumlords from turning dilapidated tenements into squalid, unsafe hotels. The council members never considered the bills' impact on Airbnb but the hotel lobby knew exactly what their proposed language meant.   The Research Works Act played out in a very similar way here in Washington. Its original sponsors understood it as the elimination of a government mandate that forced researchers to embrace a specific business model. The academic publishers who sponsored the bill knew very well that it would slow competition from open-access journals.   I could go on and on.  Telecom companies asking regulators to impose new burdens on Skype, or toy manufacturers asking regulators to force Etsy sellers who make hand-carved wooden toys to be subjected to a rigorous certification process that only makes sense for large manufacturers.   The point is that we have to step back and see these policy proposals as the inevitable byproduct of the transformation of our economy.  We have to see them as a part of the competition between the bureaucratic hierarchical model for the creation of economic value that has dominated the economy for the last 130 years and the new emergent economics of networks.   We need to be smart enough to recognize that it is not consumers asking for these regulatory or legal restrictions, it is the incumbents.  We need to defend the freedom to innovate because it is critical to the health of our economy. Our economy is today one of the most innovation-friendly economies in the world. Until recently, no one investing in or creating a business on the Internet would have considered building their business anywhere else.   But the recent enforcement actions against MegaUpload and JotForm, have forced entrepreneurs and investors in Internet services that enable users to upload content to the web to rethink where their businesses are based.   I don't know the particulars of the JotForm case and it is very hard to defend the behavior of the MegaUpload founders but it is also impossible to ignore the fact that the site takedowns made it impossible for hundreds of thousands or millions of users to get to the completely legitimate content they stored on those services.   In the weeks that followed those takedowns, every one of our portfolio companies had to reconsider where their users' data is stored. All of them are now wondering if they should be moving to domain name servers outside this country.   The Internet is a global network. There are countries out there that recognize the opportunity to create an Internet Enterprise Zone. They are working to establish a policy framework that protects user data, and more broadly the freedom to innovate. I can not tell when or even if data and the good systems administration jobs that go with it will move offshore, but I can tell you that the conversation has already started.  But networks are not just critical to our economy. They are crucial to a vital civil society. It is pretty clear that we will not be able to continue to live in the manner in which we have become accustomed.  We are very likely not going to be able to support things we value like the arts or social services in the way that we'd like. We are going to have to learn to do more with less.   Networks can play a role here as well. Kickstarter, a crowd-funding network, launched only a few years ago, will provide more support for creators this year than the National Endowment for the Arts.   In the UK, lawmakers are just as frustrated as we are that banks are still not lending to small businesses, but their regulatory framework has allowed Funding Circle, a peer-to-peer network of lenders and borrowers to flourish. Lawmakers have begun encouraging their constituents not just to ""shop local"" and ""eat local"". They are asking them to ""lend local"", creating a brand new source of working capital for small businesses and an emotional and financial return for lenders.   There are many many other examples of networks making a difference in civil society from mapping slums in Kenya, to getting at risk kids in New York to take better care of their health, to empowering mothers in Boston to take on gang violence.  If we defend the freedom to innovate, we will find lots of ways to efficiently deliver important social benefits. Of course, we should expect the same resistance from the incumbent bureaucracies in the public sector who regard those services as their turf.  Innovation depends on keeping the costs of innovation down, making sure that financing is available, and making sure that markets are accessible. It does not depend on R&D grants or targeted industrial policy.   So the next time you see a piece of legislation that has an impact on an open Internet, software or business method patents, copyright enforcement, free and fair competition, open government, or cyber security, I urge you to see it through the lens of the competition between incumbent industrial hierarchies and emergent networks.   Consider who is sponsoring the legislation. Does it really protect consumers or does it protect the business models and cost structures of the incumbents?  I recently heard a woman from the Occupy movement say the most poignant thing. She said ""no one is coming for us"". Her generation does not expect the government to be there when they need it, nor do they think the incumbent industrial hierarchies are structured or motivated to address the challenges they expect to face.   Remarkably, she was not depressed, defeated or bitter. She was determined. The kids who grew up inside AOL chat rooms and came of age on Facebook have an intuitive understanding of the power of networks that our generation will never have.   They are not asking us to fix the problems we left them with. They are asking us not to get in their way as they try to dig themselves out. I think we owe them that.   Thank you."
Funding Circle,aweissman,2012-04-01 07:15:58,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"The shift from hierarchical models of resource allocation to more efficient marketplaces is occurring not only in handmade goods or creative projects, but in the provision of financial services as well. New digitally-native financial services that use technology in ways that directly benefit the customers of those services are emerging in areas ranging from personal finance and lending to trading and business lending. Many of these native services take the form of loosely coupled networks and marketplaces, which operate based upon the principle that transparent, real-time information flows enable users to get faster results and investors better returns.  Funding Circle, an online marketplace for the provision of loans to small businesses in the UK, is one of these new services. The Funding Circle marketplace connects thousands of businesses directly to thousands of lenders, thereby cutting out traditional banks and the high costs and long processing times associated with them. The marketplace operates in a transparent manner - allowing investors to see in real time the prospective loans and the bids and rates on those, while borrowers can also see how investors are evaluating and pricing their debt and other activities in the marketplace. In the past 18 months, the Funding Circle marketplace has enabled over $45,000,000 of loans to almost 700 small business borrowers, with average yields for investors of 8.4%. It also has an active real-time secondary market - over $1,000,000 of 'loan parts' were traded in February alone.  Because Funding Circle is Internet-based, the transparency around data built into its lending marketplace has enabled it to build a sophisticated risk model for its lenders - one that utilizes a pool of borrowers that are qualified through rapid analysis of publicly available Internet credit and information databases. This enables borrowers to get rapid feedback on their credit prospects, and lenders appropriate returns while also managing their risk. Over time the company will use the Internet to extend this pool and manage the risk to lenders even further, through additional sources like borrower history on the platform and even more peer produced methods of rating credit.  Participants in the Funding Circle marketplace also help small businesses, the backbone of any economy, to grow and expand, while getting a great return. The UK government recently announced it will invest $160,000,000 in non-traditional lending channels that can reach smaller businesses, including peer to peer lending platforms.  We are excited to announce today that we are backing the Funding Circle team and participating in their Series B financing, along with Index Ventures.  We believe this approach of financing businesses - away from banks and towards a marketplace model - is powerful and more beneficial to all participants."
"The Twitter ""Patent Hack""",fredwilson,2012-04-18 06:50:37,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Yesterday Twitter announced that they plan to amend the assignments agreements that they sign with their employees. They call this proposed amendment the Innovator's Patent Agreement. I've been aware of this effort inside of Twitter for a while and I like to call this move the ""Twitter Patent Hack"" because I think what they have done is very clever and is likely to have a material change in the way patents are used to foster and/or hinder innovation, as the case may be.  Specifically Twitter has said that they will only used these assigned patent rights defensively to protect themselves against hostile actions. And further that any company that acquires these patent rights from Twitter will need the inventor's consent to use them in an offensive action. Twitter has also provided the inventor with certain rights to license the patent to others for defensive purposes. You can read the entire set of provisions on GitHub.  The other day I talked about Insurgents vs Incumbents. This is the framework we use at USV to think about a lot of things. And in the world of patents, the advantage goes to the Incumbents who can hoard patents and use them to their advantage. The insurgent, three engineers in a walk up in Bushwick, can't even afford the lawyer or the time to file a patent. So it is very encouraging to see an emerging incumbent, Twitter, do something like this. They are saying to the world that they do not intend to compete on the basis of patents and instead they will compete on the basis of product, feature set, user experience, etc, etc.  USV is committed to support this initiative. We are instructing the startup lawyers we work with to insert the patent hack language in our standard forms. We are reaching out to our friends in the startup world including other VCs, accelerator programs, and the startup lawyer universe to suggest that they to insert the patent hack into their standard forms. And we will recommend to our existing portfolio companies that they adopt it as well. Of course, entrepreneurs and their companies will have to be the ultimate determinator of whether they want this provision in their inventions assignments agreement. If an entrepreneur we invest in does not want this provision, we will certainly support that position. But we will want to have a conversation about why they would want to do that.  I will end this post with a story. Many years ago now, my prior venture capital firm, Flatiron Partners, invested in a company called Thinking Media. It was an early Internet company. They developed some browser based javascript tracking technology. The company ulimately failed but was sold in a fire sale including the patents. Those patents eventually made their way to an incumbent, the big marketing research company Nielsen. Fast forward ten years or so and Nielsen sued two of my portfolio companies, comScore and TACODA, and a bunch of other companies too, on the basis of the Thinking Media patents. So IP that was partially funded by our firm was used to sue other portfolio companies. It is so galling to have this kind of thing happen and it is one of the many reasons why I have come to believe that software and business method patents are an enemy of innovation in the tech sector.  If Thinking Media had the patent hack in their documents, the story I just told would not have happened. And thanks to Twitter's leadership, I hope that all future USV portfolio companies will have the patent hack in their documents and stories like that one will be a thing of the past. I'd like to thank Twitter's leadership team, especially the legal and engineering teams, for coming up with such an elegant and simple solution to this thorny problem. The startup world is a better place today than it was yesterday as a result of their work."
Hacking Society,nickgrossman,2012-04-24 00:15:57,1,0,[u'nickgrossman'],"Today we are excited to bring together a group of thinkers and doers to USV to discuss how networks are transforming our society and economy, and what this means for the future of innovation, competition, regulation and policy advocacy.  We are calling the event Hacking Society, which is, of course, ambitiously broad.  What we mean by that is the way in which networks — i.e., groups of people connected directly to one another via the Internet — are finding new ways to work together, make things and solve problems.  As this happens — and it's happening across all sectors of life, from entertainment, to education, to healthcare, to disaster relief, to government — tensions are arising between these emergent networks and our incumbent industries and institutions, and battles are playing out across the policy and political landscape.  Recent events have shown us both that the networked citizenry can display significant power when it needs to, and also that the fight for our networked future is far from over.  During today's session we'll discuss how networks are changing our world, how incumbents are fighting back in policy and political arenas, what a ""freedom to innovate"" policy agenda could look like, and how we can best harness the strengths of the Net as we advocate for our new, connected future.  We'll be providing a live audio stream all day, so please feel free to join in.  We'll also be tweeting to the #hacksociety hashtag, so please post comments and questions there, and/or tweet at @usv throughout the day.  After the event, we'll provide complete audio and video footage, which will be available for download under a Creative Commons license.  The live audio stream, plus a list of everyone attending the event in person, can be found at:  http://hackingsociety.us  Thanks in advance to everyone who will be joining us today, both in person and online, and here's to the Internet.  Nick Grossman is a Visiting Scholar at the MIT Media Lab, and is working with the USV team on a new advocacy effort focused on networks and innovation."
B Corporation ,albertwenger,2012-05-10 10:16:21,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Etsy announced yesterday that the company has become a Certified B Corporation. In doing so Etsy joins a growing group of now over 500 companies that includes Patagonia and Seventh Generation. We are excited about this as it fits well with our beliefs about the changing role of businesses.   Etsy is a great example of the Internet-based networks and marketplaces that are reshaping our economy and society. At Union Square Ventures, these types of networks are central to our investment thesis. We are committed to protecting and enhancing the freedom for networks to form and operate, which was a key theme of our recent Hacking Society event.   We are also interested in what makes a network or marketplace sustainable over time. We have come to believe that the best long term steward of a network will be a company that focuses on value creation for all participants in the network instead of solely for its shareholders. Becoming certified as a B Corp provides a measurement framework that dovetails extremely well with this more comprehensive approach.  Several US states including California and New York have already adopted laws to allow companies to make this broader commitment part of their legal foundation by changing their bylaws to formally become a so-called Benefit Corporation (instead of a C Corp). Most venture backed companies are incorporated in Delaware and while they can get certified like Etsy, they will have to wait until Delaware adopts the Benefit Corporation before they can change their legal status.  If you want to learn more about why Etsy chose to become certified as a B Corp please CEO Chad Dickerson's great blog post placing it in the context of their just completed funding round."
Behance,albertwenger,2012-05-14 10:55:12,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"We have long believed that the Internet is about giving ""power to the people."" One way in which the Internet does that is by letting people show what they have created to the world.  People do that in all sorts of ways, for instance by posting on blogs and Youtube.    This is a bit like ""show your work"" in school tests -- by doing so you can get credit for it.  On the Internet, new connections can then form on the basis of the creations as others discover your work.  There are dedicated networks emerging that facilitate this approach. For instance, developers can show their code via Github, connect with other developers (in fact work jointly on projects) and in many cases find new work opportunities.  For creatives, Behance has been pursuing a similar goal for years: show your work, connect with other creatives and find new opportunities.  We are excited to be investing in Behance as they grow the Behance network, enhance their Prosite offering and develop other features to support collaboration among creatives and between creatives and their clients.  You can read more over at Behance's blog. "
Investment Thesis @USV,aweissman,2012-05-27 07:36:05,7,0,"[u'aweissman', u'mitgc_cm', u'mckaythomas', u'unger', u'N_Clemmons', u'Nivo0o0', u'KunalTandon']","Venture firms operate a bunch of different ways. Some have a geographical focus, others have a sector focus, still others have a stage focus. Union Square Ventures' focus has evolved into what we call a ""thesis"" but is probably better described as a macro level view about the world - the Internet world - that we then (attempt) to structure investment activities around. In short, as described by Brad last year in 140 characters, USV invests in:  
Large networks of engaged users, differentiated through user experience, and defensible through network effects.
  When we are organizing our activities and thinking about investment decisions then, we parse that a little finer, we unpack some of the components. ""Large"" obviously requires scale - Twitter is a great example. But it can also mean large relative to a specific problem set or community. Stack Exchange is comprised of over 80 question and answer sites. Some of those sites, like Server Fault, are designed for very specific communities, but aim to have most of the potential members of that community as active participants. Similarly, Behance is designed for the world's creative professionals.  ""Networks"" are of course interconnected groups or systems, but they also come in a few flavors. For example, networks can be centered around person-to-person sharing of an activity (foursquare, Soundcloud), facilitating a transaction (Dwolla), enabling creativity (Tumblr, Wattpad), person-to-person marketplaces (Etsy, Kickstarter), or business and personal finance marketplaces (Lending Club, Funding Circle). Marketplaces have some of the more interesting network components and use the efficient exchange of information to produce superior economics and create new economies in their area of focus. Examples include the creative projects that wouldn't otherwise come to fruition if the Kickstarter marketplace was not active, the individuals finding work through Workmarket's labor resource market, or the active secondary market in small business loans (and pieces thereof) being traded through Funding Circle. Finally, networks can also be networks of data, such as what DuckDuckGo (search), Indeed (jobs) and Flurry (mobile apps) are doing that then provide aggregate data-level benefits to users from that data network aggregation.  We will also look closely at the ""user experience"" of these networks, being most interested in novel (""differentiated"") web and mobile native interface ways to engage users around a solution to the particular problem, one that is consistent with the fabric of the users' experiences. The foursquare check-in is a good illustration of a native behavior designed in the context of exploring a city, as is Codecademy's method of teaching people to program by writing code inside a browser window. Similarly, Canvas provides a unique set of tools to play with images, thereby encouraging the remix and sharing of them, turntable's entire experience is designed to play music with other people, and tumblr's dashboard is a method of following and reacting to and with creativity. Unique user experience also extends beyond the user interface - it's the design of the entire system: how it functions, what is allowed; what isn't allowed; what values are inherent in the prospective functioning of the service. Kickstarter's incentive/pledge system, with minimum goals and rewards, is an example of a unique experience that is well-aligned with the goals of the service itself (participating in creativity). As Albert recently wrote about Etsy: ""the best long term steward of a network will be a company that focuses on value creation for all participants in the network instead of solely for its shareholders.""  The last component of this thesis relates to businesses that create barriers to entry through ""network effects"", in which the value of a service to a user increases as others use it. This can potentially arise in a number of ways: for example a proprietary data asset; the marketplace dynamics of having a robust set of sellers and buyers; or through the development of a community that openly shares and exchanges information. In an era where the initial cost to develop the prototype of a product has been dramatically reduced, where there are mature and scalable open source tools and services to utilize for that development, and where cloud infrastructure is available on demand and at a variable cost, defensibility may no longer be found in the technology underpinnings - the code or IP - of a service. Defensibility may however arise through the growth of service that gets more valuable, and more interesting, with each new participant. One nice example of this is Twitter, which is so potentially valuable because, put simply, that's where the Tweets as well as the personal follower/following relationships reside. The value of these businesses tends to be composed of the very networks they have created.  Taken together, these components comprise how USV looks at the Internet at large to find places where we should invest and where we can be good partners. Of course, the components are not monolithic and are subject to nuance and interpretation (see for example ""Do Network Effects Span Geographies""; ""How Strong Are Network Effects Online, REALLY""), but again, of course, that's what makes them most interesting.  "
The Next Stage of USV.com,aweissman,2012-06-06 15:52:40,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"Almost seven years ago, USV decided that our web site should be a blog. One that allowed for a varied and ongoing conversation with the world and one that could evolve over time.    Fast forward to 2012: we realized USV folks publish different things, in different places and at different times; our portfolio companies and their teams create content spread over the web; and the USV network produces a vast amount of interesting material.  It led us to consider the next stage of the evolution of the Union Square Ventures internet presence, and our instincts are telling us it may look and feel more like an application or web/mobile service that aggregates content rather than strict content publishing.
  
We are therefore looking for someone who can help us build this specific project. Someone who is well versed in web and mobile and design methodologies but who is also a creative thinker. We have some basic ideas of the application we would like to build, but these are not set in stone; we value someone who can not only design and build but also help with the initial brainstorming, ideas, scope and prototyping.  We imagine this opportunity will be of a few months duration. If this sounds like fun to you please tell us a little about yourself in the form below.

We received many outstanding applications and spent the fall reading blog posts, following Twitter streams, poking at side projects, and interviewing candidates.   We met a number of extraordinary people through the process, and making one hire wasn't easy. We also thought about how much Union Square Ventures has grown over the past two years, with new partners, a new fund, and new investments.

Hello World,AlexanderPease,2012-06-26 12:42:54,2,0,"[u'AlexanderPease', u'avi_dorfman']","I first came to USV one year ago, almost to the day, as a hackNY fellow. Fred, Brad and Albert gave a talk about venture capital, with a special emphasis on the New York tech ecosystem. I've been following them ever since.  My name is Alexander Pease, although most everyone calls me Zander. Along with Brian, I am excited to be joining the USV investment team. I've just graduated from Princeton with an A. B. in Physics. I wrote my thesis on light-matter interactions in superconducting photonic circuits, attempting to engineer the fundamental building blocks of quantum information for practical use. I am looking forward to switching gears and studying, at the opposite end of the spectrum, the behavior of the vast networks of data underlying our investment thesis.   Having just exposed my nerdiness, I might as well also mention that I love to code. As a hackNY fellow I worked as a developer making social games for Vostu, Inc. Afterwards, I did a bit of freelance for Today's Kicks. The previous summer I worked at the MIT Media Labs, writing the first iteration of iOS software for NETRA. I am also the founder of MetroGnome, interactive music education software for the iPad. There's quite a bit of work left on this project but I'm encouraged by the progress to date.  A bit about me: I've been lucky enough to spend a good portion of my life in Asia, living in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore for about 9 years. I've studied classical piano, the perfect instrument to wedge into a small Manhattan apartment, throughout my entire life. And I grew up playing tennis but somehow became a long jumper on the Princeton track and field team.  Central to USV's culture is blogging and the debate of ideas, trends and insights.

Joining USV,fredwilson,2012-06-26 12:48:25,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Hi there, I'm Brian, one of the new analysts (along with Zander) joining the investment team at Union Square Ventures. I couldn't be more excited to get started at USV, examining and investing in the open internet through connected innovation.  I've recently graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. in Engineering Management Systems, a degree that remixes traditional industrial engineering with economics and computer science. In the past I've worked for companies at all stages of growth. I've organized my hometown community in support of policy reform with Organizing for America, analyzed social data with Trendrr, developed Chase Community Giving with JPMorgan Chase & Co., and drove user acquisition and community engagement with Gilt Groupe.  I'm fascinated with how people organize and interact online, and I'm particularly passionate about empowering the next generation of entrepreneurs to create businesses that advance our society and economy. With more of us accessing the internet, our challenge is to develop (and discover) new businesses that help us solve problems, reach new audiences, and create value for everyone involved. At USV, these are the things we think about each and every day.  When I'm not working, I like listening to Hip-Hop music, watching the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, exploring Harlem, and sometimes blogging about cool sneakers. If you're interested to get to know me, feel free to say ""hi"" or even ""what's up."" I'm on Twitter over here, and I blog over there. "
Brewster,fredwilson,2012-07-12 06:40:49,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Twenty years into the personal technology revolution and we are still using address books that work pretty much like physical address books. It makes no sense. The mobile address book should be hyperconnected to our digital life, informed by it, and responsive to it.
I remember back in early 2011, Steve Greenwood walked into our old offices on the 14th floor and told us that he intended to build that hyperconnected mobile address book. He showed us a spreadsheet he had been personally using for the past five or so years to manage all of his relationships. I had never seen anything like it. He was obsessed with relationships and managing them. That's what we are always looking for, someone who just can't sleep because they want to fix something that isn't working in their world and have been trying for a long time to fix it.
Steve had built a prototype that ran on the web and the vision was all there. An address book that knows what you are doing, where you are, who you are most engaged with at any time, and is search and context driven as opposed to a directory of names and addresses.
But Steve knew that he had to launch this as a mobile app that will eventually replace your current address book and he knew he had a lot of hard technical problems to solve in order to do it right and do it at scale. So he asked us for the seed capital to build a team and build that product. We said yes.
Today, Steve and the amazing team he put together are launching Brewster, initially as an iOS app. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can download it from the iOS app store and check it out. The NY Times has a good post on Brewster today.
Here's how Brewster works. You download the app. You connect it to google apps, facebook, twitter, foursquare, linkedin, and soon a bunch more services. Brewster builds you a new address book that runs on your phone and also in the cloud.
This new address book is smart because it knows a lot more things about your relationships than you have ever entered into your address book and it is adapting in real-time to all of this data. It knows who you probably want to talk to right now and it also knows who you are losing touch with and displays all of this data in a feed. Your Brewster address book is also de-duped and hot linked to all the social activities you want to do from calling, texting, facebooking, or whatever.
This is an address book that can handle a search query like ""knicks game"" or ""sushi tonight"" or ""band of horses concert"". We are always querying our brain with questions like that. Now we can ask our address books those kinds of questions.
I have really enjoyed being involved with this project over the past year. It fits neatly into many themes I have been writing about and thinking about for years. But mostly I am excited to finally see this product out in the market where folks can use it and experience Steve's vision of how an address book should work in the mobile social world we live in."
Networks And The Enterprise,fredwilson,2012-08-30 11:45:49,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Many think that USV is a consumer web investor. We don't think of ourselves that way. We invest in networks and for most of our short history, that has meant investing in networks of individuals connecting with each other. Thus the consumer web investor moniker.
But if you go back over the past four years and analyze the roughly thirty investments we have made in that time period, you will see that a good portion, maybe a third, have been in networks where enterprises participate.
I like to think that our first foray into this kind of network was 10gen, the company behind MongoDB. MongoDB is an open source datastore for web scale applications. The first users were developers who wanted a simple, easy to get started datastore. It was perfect for hackathons and such where the developer needed to get something up quickly. This post I read yesterday does a good job of explaining why MongoDB took off. These developers became a network of users and contributors to the open source project. Many of them worked in enterprises and brought MongoDB into their teams. Soon enough 10gen started getting calls from executives saying something like ""I just learned that we have 50 instances of MongoDB in production and I'm eager to get a support contract"". That's where the enterprises joined the network.
A year later we invested in Twilio. It's a similar story. Twilio build a dead simple API and cloud service that allowed developers to quickly connect their apps to the world of telephony and SMS. The early users were the same kinds of developers who adopted MongoDB. The classic Twilio story is where the two founders of Groupme built the initial version of their app at the TechCrunch hackathon using Twilio. But again, these developers became a network and the adoption spread into the enterprise.
When an enterprise plugs into a network of developers and tools built in this way they get more than functionality. They get a platform that a lot of engineers know how to use and is becoming a standard in the market. There is tremendous value to the enterprise in these networks over time.
A year later we invested in WorkMarket. WorkMarket built a platform that allows enterprises to take their freelance workforces and put them onto an open shared network. But of course, once a bunch of enterprises do this there becomes a large supply of freelance workers on the platform that can be shared amoung the various enterprises. When an enterprise joins WorkMarket, they don't just get functionality. They get access to skilled workers. Lots of them.
Around the time we invested in WorkMarket, we also invested in Edmodo. Edmodo is a platform that allows teachers and students to connect to each other and communicate, share reading assignments, homework, practice tests, and such. Edmodo currently connects 9.3mm students and teachers worldwide.The Edmodo platform was adopted initially by teachers looking for a better solution to communicate with their students. But like the 10gen story, Edmodo started getting calls from Principals and School Systems looking to deploy the Edmodo platform across their entire enterprise.
One of our favorite kind of networks are marketplaces. And a particularly interesting category of marketplaces are lending marketplaces. We have invested in one called Funding Circle that connects enteprises, mostly small businesses, in the UK with a network of lenders. The more lenders that come into Funding Circle, the more attractive it is to borrowers. And the more high quality lending opportunities that come into Funding Circle, the more attractive it is to lenders. A classic network effect that drives value for small business borrowers.
Our two most recent investments, one of which is unannouced, are networks where enterprises play a big role. The one I can talk about, Behance, is a network of creative professionals, many of whom work in enterprises like agencies. Behance started out as a place where creative professionals could come and showcase their work. But quickly organizations like schools, publications, associations and the like asked Behance to power their networks. These enterprises plugged into the Behance network and created a network of networks.
Sometimes consumer networks can get pulled into the enterprise. A good example of that is Disqus, which started out as a network of bloggers and commenters talking to each other. But a year or so into its life, Disqus started hearing from big media companies who wanted to deploy the Disqus comment system. So slowly but surely Disqus has built a large user base among commercial publishers. And these commericial publishers get way more than functionality when they plug into the Disqus network. They get access to hundreds of millions of monthly viewers and the engagement they create.
We also occaionally invest in data networks in addition to networks of people. I've been involved in one of those for over a decade. It is called Return Path and I invested in it at both Flatiron Partners and Union Square Ventures, the only company that has that distinction. Return Path has constructed a very large data network where all the various participants in the email ecosystem (mailers, intermidiaries, recievers, consumers) contribute data to their system. That data is used to power a bunch of value added products that all go toward making sure the right mail gets to the right person and spam and related bad stuff don't. Every time a new participant in the ecosystem joins the Return Path data network, their systems and tools get smarter, making the service more valuable for everyone. That's a classic network effect and it is very powerful.
This post has gone on longer than I would normally like. And I am certain that I've left out a number of USV portfolio companies that are building networks where the enterprise is a participant. I am sorry if I failed to mention your business in this post.
My uber goal of writing this post is to explain that the wired and mobile internet is a global network and it powers all sorts of smaller networks to get built on top of it. These networks can often include small and large enterprises in them. And we like to invest in networks regardless of whether the enterprise is engaged or not. Increasingly it seems we like to invest in ones where the enterprise is part of the story."
Pollenware,johnbuttrick,2012-09-05 17:02:18,1,0,[u'johnbuttrick'],"If you follow our investment strategy, you know we love internet-based marketplaces that enable direct transactions between interested parties. What is less well known is that our focus extends beyond consumer-facing marketplaces such as Etsy and Lending Club. Last week Fred blogged about our investments in companies that serve enterprises and today we are delighted to add Pollenware, a company based in Kansas City, to that list.  Pollenware has created a sophisticated marketplace for one of the largest but most overlooked areas of finance: working capital. To give you a sense of scale, the company estimates that global working capital flows between businesses and their suppliers total more than USD $200 trillion annually. These flows (and credit operations) operate constantly between buyers and sellers, usually in cycles of 30 to 90 days.   Historically, buyers have turned to third parties to invest excess cash, while sellers needing cash have had to borrow against the receivable or sell it at a discount to banks or factoring companies. These latter transactions generally involve legal paperwork, covenants, an analysis of the buyer's credit risk and costs to the seller.  With the Pollenware (C2FO) solution, no intermediaries are necessary and there is no incremental credit risk. Buyers and sellers come together in the (C2FO) market to negotiate the value of early payment. Buyers allocate cash to fund the sellers discount offers which are made in the live, bid/ask market environment. It's a strong value proposition for both parties. Buyers get a better financial return than almost any other available short-term investment and sellers get a smaller discount than they would have received from a third party.  Already there are thousands of buyers and sellers on the Pollenware platform, including a number of brand name Fortune 500 companies. In 2012, the company expects its marketplace to transact more than $3 billion of early payments.   While there is a lot of work to do, the company is off to a great start and we are excited to lead its Series B round. The founder is Sandy Kemper, who ran a bank earlier in his career and has a deep understanding of working capital finance. We look forward to helping Sandy and his team build a world class global business over the next few years."
Looking for Design Talent,albertwenger,2012-10-10 08:47:50,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"We are excited to announce a Behance talent audition to identify five designers that will be commissioned to update the look and feel of USV's identity. You can find a detailed design brief at Behance. We have decided on a network-based approach, leveraging our portfolio company Behance’s design community, because it is a natural fit with networks as our central investment thesis and our rethinking of USV.com as more of a network.  Rather than spec work, we are using Behance to conduct a talent audition based on existing work first and will then commission five designers. This means that everyone creating new work for this project will be compensated -- not just the one winner who will carry out our complete brand identity. This model has a storied tradition, dating at least as far back as the design competition for the dome of the Florence Cathedral. We believe that it strikes the right balance between open access and properly valuing the work of all participating designers.  Central to our overall investing thesis is the belief that the internet enables the creation of new networks that can replace traditional hierarchical organizations across the economy and society. Networks tend to be powerful because they are more resilient, more effective and more inclusive. Steven Johnson’s new book Future Perfect coins the term “peer progressives” to describe this position.  Most of our portfolio companies have some kind of network effect in which the services become more valuable for everyone as the number of people or companies using them increases. We are also trying to use the network as much as possible for the day-to-day operation of Union Square Ventures. For instance, we use an open process for hiring new analysts and recently published our background materials and investment theses for online education. We are also facilitating networks among our portfolio companies by organizing in-person meetings and online forums.  Our network, including the portfolio companies and their employees, all produce a vast amount of interesting content across the web. Our current web presence was launched as a blog in 2005 to facillitate a more open dialogue; but it does not reflect this broader network. We are working on a new version that will aggregate and surface content from across our network.   So if you are interested in participating in the design please head over to Behance for instructions. If you know someone who should participate please let them know. And everyone can influence the selection process through appreciating (a “like” on Behance) the work of participating designers."
Visualizing our Investments,fredwilson,2012-11-30 16:34:37,1,0,[u'fredwilson'],"Union Square Ventures is a thesis driven firm. We don't really invest in the consumer web, networks, mobile, the cloud, or any specific technology. We invest in the disruption of the global economy caused by the increasing liquidity of information enabled by the internet. Our thesis allows us to find opportunities as the investment landscape changes.   We recently created the USV Portfolio Timeline so that we could better understand how our approach to investing has evolved with the market. We often reflect on these trends, and we wanted to create an alternate view of the USV portfolio that organizes our investments by ""Theme"" and ""Stage.""   A couple of current trends jump out from this presentation. First, USV is investing more frequently in Series B rounds and fewer seed rounds. Second, that we are finding interesting opportunities in enterprise, finance and education.  Zach, our hacker-in-residence and I developed the timeline using an open-source project, TimelineJS. The theme view arranges our portfolio into six investment areas: Advertising technology, Developer tools, Education, Enterprise, Marketplaces, and Social & Search. The stage view organizes our investments by the stage (Seed, Series A, Series B, or later) of our initial investment. We will continue to improve and update the timeline as we invest in more companies.  We hope you'll enjoy playing around with the Portfolio Timeline as much as we do. We are sharing it with you, because we have always learned much more by sharing our work than we have by keeping it to ourselves. The timeline has been helpful to our team, and we hope that it provides more context around our approach and the types of opportunities that we're looking for."
Behance Joins Adobe To Scale Creative Network,albertwenger,2012-12-20 16:13:40,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Earlier this year we invested in New York based Behance. We had known and followed Scott and the team for several years and kept an active dialog about the network of creatives that they have been building. As it turns out, we are not the only ones who believe that this will be an important network. Today, the company announced that it is joining Adobe.  As part of this transaction Adobe is making a major commitment to build out its presence in New York which will be led by the Behance team. This is terrific news for New York as yet another major West Coast company sets up shop here following the likes of Google, Salesforce (Buddy Media), Twitter and eBay (Hunch).  Behance will remain an independent brand within Adobe and continue to focus on building out the features and scale of the Behance Network, now backed by the resources of a large public company.  You can read a more about what it all means over on Behance's blog. Our congratulations to the teams at Behance and Adobe!

Hailo,johnbuttrick,2013-02-05 10:34:20,1,0,[u'johnbuttrick'],"We're excited to announce today that USV led the recent round of financing in Hailo, the e-hail company based in London and New York. Hailo is rapidly becoming a global platform for regulated taxi service and we are delighted to join existing investors Accel, Atomico and Wellington, as well as new investors Phenomen, KDDI and Sir Richard Branson.   For more than a year, we have watched the Hailo management team roll out their service. The team did an extraordinary job of execution. They first launched the app in London in the fall of 2011 and were the seventh or eighth app in this market. By the end of 2012 they were the dominant app, with half of London's 23,000 London black cab signed up for the service and consumers downloading the app at strong month over month growth rates despite minimal marketing. Similar trends are evident in the next two markets the company entered, Dublin and Toronto.   This financing will enable Hailo to enter markets in the United States, including our hometown New York City later this month, as well as Japan and Continental Europe. While every city has different customs, dynamics and regulatory structures, the basic need is the same: providing a service that directly connects drivers and riders in real-time at reasonable prices.   With Hailo you no longer have to worry about whether the cab you are trying to find will make an unexpected turn or pick up another passenger before it gets to you. With both the drivers and the passengers changing location all the time, this is truly a native use case for mobile apps.  The company has six founders, three of whom are executives and three of whom are former London taxi drivers. They have a sense of humor and call themselves The Big Wigs. There is a good interview in the Wall Street Journal published this morning with Jay Bregman, Hailo's CEO, that is worth reading and gives a sense of why we chose to invest. We are happy to be along for the, er, ride."
Sift Science,albertwenger,2013-03-18 22:03:52,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"As more and more economic activity moves online, fraud is never far behind. Online fraud is in many ways more attractive to criminals as it can be committed at a safe distance from its targets and scales far better. It is therefore not surprising that online fraud has been growing rapidly, is well organized and technologically sophisticated.  There are two different possible responses to online fraud. On the one hand there is legislation and enforcement. That has proven difficult and problematic. Difficult because much of the fraud emanates from different jurisdictions altogether, some of which have shown little to no interest in enforcement. And problematic because of the unintended side effects of legislation, such as the overly restrictive CFAA.  On the other hand there is fighting fraud with technology. Almost two years ago a small team formed Sift Science with the goal of using the latest advances in machine learning to provide a fraud fighting solution to anyone operating on the Internet. Today Sift Science is making their solution publicly available with a self service sign up. Behind the scenes it has already been fighting fraud at such companies as AirBnB, Uber, Listia and Affirm as well as a several mobile applications, payment processors and online retailers.  Sift Science's machine learning algorithm constantly uncovers new fraud patterns. Because Sift Science operates as a network of participating companies, a pattern that is discovered in one part of the network is immediately recognized for all other participants. The results have been outstanding, with fraud losses reduced by as much as 90%. By offering such a powerful solution in a self service model, Sift Science is helping to address the large fraud protection gap that exists today. According to the Lexis Nexis 2012 ""True Cost of Fraud"" study, less than a quarter of merchants use automated transaction scoring. Sift Science's self service signup and an easy to use API can make a big difference here.  For all of these reasons we are thrilled to be investors in Sift Science. You can read more about Sift Science's technology and service offering on their blog. Or you can simply go ahead and sign up for their service."
Kitchensurfing,aweissman,2013-04-03 15:13:02,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"What's in your kitchen? Probably a stove, sink, running water, oven, refrigerator, cutlery and other utensils, sometimes a microwave oven. Precisely the same things as every commercial restaurant kitchen. Every kitchen is indeed an ad hoc restaurant waiting to happen. What do you do in your kitchen? Do you cook or express yourself? Probably a combination of both; and sometimes you don't feel like doing either. At the same time, most chefs have few outlets for expression outside of working in a restaurant. And very few of those restaurant cooks are able to create their own singular platforms.  Of course, this is the kind of mismatch that the Internet - which enables frictionless discovery and sharing of information - was made for. And Kitchensurfing was developed to fill this gap. The service allows anyone to find and book a chef (in an environment you control) whose expertise is varied and diverse, professional and amateur, at prices that are competitive with restaurants. Ranging from Alexander T (the Breakfast Bachelor), who just does brunches, Melissa Danielle (Badass Blender Woman) who makes drinks using only a Vitamix blender, to Retno Pratiwi, Indonesian street food. Closer to home, if you have specific food restrictions in your life like my family does, you might find the whole food business to be intimidating and impenetrable. Or, using Kitchensurfing you can find a ""renegade"" cook named Dan who can handle any kind of food allergy and create an incredible safe meal.  Kitchensurfing's managed to create a peer Internet marketplace and a community that unbundles and redefines the very idea of eating local. Chris, Lars and Bo have built a simple to use solution that, like themselves, reflects the diversity of what it means to cook. Available in three cities now (New York, Boston and Berlin) with more (Chicago, Washington, DC) coming online in the next few weeks, Kitchensurfing is making it far easier for cooks to be entrepreneurs by matching them with people and homes. It empowers chefs to create the life they want to lead freed from the constraints of a restaurant. There are now thousands of cooks on the platform and this unique and varied marketplace has tripled in size since the end of last year.  We are pleased to be investors in Kitchensurfing. Kitchensurfing is giving people amazing meals and experiences in their homes, thereby democratizing the business of restaurants and changing their definition."
Foursquare Checks In,albertwenger,2013-04-11 01:03:12,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"Today Foursquare announced that it has raised $41 million coming from its existing investors (including USV) and adding Silver Lake's Waterman Fund. This puts the company in a great position to continue executing at the intersection of local, mobile and social. That opportunity today is larger and clearer than ever before as smartphone adoption has skyrocketed and the couponing craze has abated.  As an avid user of Foursquare though what's more exciting is the latest Foursquare experience which is now available on both iOS and Android. The latest releases put search and discovery right on top with a prominent search box. This past Sunday, my wife Susan and I went to an outdoor furniture store in Soho which promptly turned out to be closed. I pulled up Foursquare, typed furniture into the search box and got an awesome map of results around me and we wound up visiting five stores, four of which I had never even heard of before (here is the web version of that search although your/logged out results will be different from mine).  Foursquare is leveraging billions of checkins to power these search results and customize them for individual users. The app now also surfaces interesting location context right on the home screen. This could be news about a restaurant that has just opened or places nearby that are of interest. During development the Foursquare team referred to these internally as ""radar cards"" and the name is apropos. It really is like having a personal radar that lets you see through buildings and around corners to get a complete context for the location you are in. That experience too is tailored to you personally which makes it feel quite magical.  The next few months will see further enhancement to the many ways in which Foursquare can be used. A little while back the company introduced the ability to link credit cards to one's foursquare account. These cards can then be used to seamlessly redeem specials. The number of specials available for ""load-to-card"" redemption will grow significantly in the coming months and will eventually be available to all businesses through a self service solution. Unlike any other solution, this does not involve showing your phone to a waiter or someone at checkout. You simply pay and any promotion is applied back to your card.  So if you have never tried out Foursquare, or used it some time back and stopped, now is a great time to give it a whirl. You can even get started by just doing a search on the web, but it is the native mobile experience where the new and improved Foursquare really shines."
Shapeways Restocks,albertwenger,2013-04-23 08:47:13,1,0,[u'albertwenger'],"In the Fall of 2010 we helped spin Shapeways out of Philips. At the time, the founders made a gutsy choice: relocating the company headquarters to New York City. They arrived here in a cold December with their families and little else. Since then it has been an amazing journey.  Here are just some of the achievements of the Shapeways team along the way: They launched production facilities in both Eindhoven and Long Island City. Last year Shapeway printed well over 1 million unique products and is now on track for 60,000 model uploads per month. Shapeways World Meetup day in February had meetups in 90 cities globally.  But the best is yet to come. Shapeways is working on many exciting initiatives such as making new materials available, speeding up delivery and further empowering creators and designers everywhere.

Science Exchange,aweissman,2013-04-29 15:40:03,1,0,[u'aweissman'],"Right now, there are thousands of scientists whose research is being held up because they lack access to the experimental expertise needed to test a hypothesis or verify a result. But while we have seen how online marketplaces can dramatically expand and create new businesses in many other diverse areas, it is still too difficult for those scientists to access the right experimental expertise.  Help is on the way. Techniques that some label ""science as a service"" are making specialized resources and institutional expertise available on demand and with openness and transparency. Science Exchange is applying these market-based principles, having created an online community for scientists to list, discover, access and pay for experimental services from research institutions around the world, thereby creating the world's first true online marketplace for specialized scientific expertise.  Almost 5,000 scientific services are listed on the Science Exchange platform, including the latest genomics and proteomics services, micro- and nanofabrication techniques, and even access to a microgravity research facility on the International Space Station. The providers already offering services on Science Exchange range from labs at the top U.S. research institutions, like Harvard, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas Health Science Center and Duke, to small independent research companies or individuals, such as Reveal Biosciences and the Voss laboratory. Using the Science Exchange platform a scientist or researcher can search for a service, compare providers and their reputations, choose a provider, pay for the transaction and manage the projects.  For maybe the first time, with this type of marketplace, individuals, labs and companies can market their core expertise, providing efficient access to the world's scientific expertise in an open manner. The easy access to scientific expertise offered by Science Exchange not only lowers the cost of research, it also significantly lowers the barrier to commercializing scientific discoveries. This makes scientific entrepreneurship more attractive. Furthermore, the platform offers new methods to fund research and evaluate reputation, and, finally, to provide equal access to all types of research expertise.   Science Exchange's mission is to democratize access the global network of scientific resources and expertise. We are excited to be investors in Science Exchange. You can read more about the company here."
Coinbase,fredwilson,2013-05-08 05:47:38,1,2,[u'fredwilson'],"We have been thinking about and looking to make an investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem for several years. Today, we are happy to be able to talk about our first investment in the sector. We have made an investment in Coinbase along with our friends at Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and Funders Club.  We believe that Bitcoin represents something fundamental and powerful, an open and distributed Internet peer to peer protocol for transferring purchasing power. It reminds us of SMTP, HTTP, RSS, and BitTorrent in its architecture and openness. Like what happened with those other low level protocols, entrepreneurs and developers are now building technology on top of Bitcoin to make it more useful, more accessible, and more secure.   Coinbase is in some ways a perfect example of that trend. It was founded by Brian Armstrong, who as an engineer at Airbnb who wanted an easier way to incorporate Bitcoin into transactional systems on the Internet. Brian was joined by co-founder Fred Ehrsam, a computer scientist and former currency trader. The two of them have quickly built Coinbase into one of the leading Bitcoin platforms in the market.  Coinbase offers three important features: an online wallet to store Bitcoin; a merchant platform that allows services to accept Bitcoin as payment; and a service that allows individuals and merchants to buy/sell Bitcoin into fiat currencies. Coinbase is located in San Francisco and the company's details and key metrics are available on its about page. Coinbase is hiring and their openings are on its jobs page. And of course, they also have a blog.  If you are a merchant and want to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, you can do that with Coinbase. The platform for accepting Bitcoin is free and you only get charged a small fee if you want to convert Bitcoin to fiat currency, which you can do automatically.   If you would like to buy Bitcoin and store it online, you can do that with Coinbase. Coinbase is where I have purchased my Bitcoin and keep it. Coinbase has native mobile wallets for iOS and Android and works great on mobile web as well.  Even though Bitcoin has been all over the media lately as its exchange rate has surged, collapsed, and surged again, we believe that we are in the very early days of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. There is much that must be built on top of of these digital currencies to make them work well enough to support real business at scale. And we are thrilled to be invested in a team that is well suited to do that work and build a large and successful business in the Bitcoin sector."
The Patent Quality Improvement Act,nickgrossman,2013-05-09 06:49:58,1,0,[u'nickgrossman'],"This week, Senator Schumer introduced legislation that would take a whack at patent trolls: the Patent Quality Improvement Act aims to make it easier and cheaper for companies facing spurious infringement suits to defend themselves. This is not a complete fix for the software patent problem, and we absolutely need go further (more on how, below), but it's a step forward and we wholeheartedly support the Senator here.  For those who are new to this problem: patent trolls are eating internet startups. ""Troll"" is another word for ""patent assertion entity"" (PAE) or ""non-practicing entity"" (NPEs) -- i.e., a company that owns the rights to patents, but rather than innovating on top of them, simply uses them to sue real innovators and extract rents.   In the particular case of software patents, this is compounded by the fact that many of these patents are so broad as to be ridiculous. Here are just a few examples (someone should make a tumblr of these - ridiculoussoftwarepatents.tumblr.com is available...).   But this is no laughing matter -- it's a huge, expensive, and potentially deadly problem facing anyone building software applications. In the USV portfolio alone, roughly 1/3 of our companies have been attacked by trolls, and have spent millions of dollars and countless hours defending themselves. It's a tax on the entire sector, and it's particularly problematic for small startups who have limited time and resources.  Patent trolls operate in a pernicious way: they start by preying on small companies (55% of companies attacked have $10mm or less in revenue), and target their settlement fees at just under the cost of litigating. This puts small companies in a difficult position: spend time and money fighting in court (which can take years and cost millions of dollars), or just pay the troll and get back to work. As trolls collect settlements from small companies, they go after bigger and bigger targets.  To make matters worse, trolls often go after the customers of their target companies, blackening reputations and damaging businesses before anything has been proven or settled. So even the threat of action is enough to put companies in a serious bind, and as a result, many simply choose to just pay up, irrespective of the merits.  All of this is undergirded by two major problems: 1) software patents are too easy to get; and 2) defending yourself against trolls is outrageously expensive and time consuming. We need to fix both problems.  The Patent Quality Improvement Act is an attempt to fix #2. It allows suits over ""Covered Business Method patents"" (which describes most software patents wielded by trolls) to be taken out of court and fast-tracked through a USPTO review process. In cases where the patents at hand are likely invalid, this will provide a necessary short circuit to the time-consuming and expensive court process.  While we are very excited to see this moving forward, we also want to be clear that this doesn't fix everything. We must still figure out how to make it harder to win bad patents (problem #1), and to continue to make it easier and cheaper to defend oneself against trolls (problem #2).  One idea for solving problem #1 is to crack down on the phenomenon of ""functional claiming"", or patenting the problem, not the solution. Professor Mark Lemley of Stanford Law School has identified this as a key driver of the software patent / trolling problem:  
""This is a problem that is unique to software. We wouldn't permit in any other area of technology the sorts of claims that appear in thousands of different software patents. Pharmaceutical inventors don't claim ""an arrangement of atoms that cures cancer,"" asserting their patent against any chemical, whatever its form, that achieves that purpose. Indeed, the whole idea seems ludicrous. Pharmaceutical patent owners invent a drug, and it is the drug that they are entitled to patent. But in software, as we will see, claims of just that form are everywhere.""
  According to his report on the subject, this can also be fixed relatively easily through simple clarification and enforcement of existing rules, not new law.  On problem #2, continuing to drive down the cost of defense, and drive up the cost of patent trolling, there are several ideas out there. One is the SHIELD act, which would institute a ""loser pays"" model for frivolous patent suits. Word on the street is that this is a non-starter in the face of opposition from the trial lawyer lobby. Other ideas include accelerating discovery, including the details of infringement claims (which are often withheld until later in the case, increasing costs); increased disclosure of the real parties of interest (who often hide behind shell corporations or licensees); and exempting end-users from infringement claims (offices using networked scanners shouldn't be sued for $1000 per user). All of these ideas seem reasonable, and would continue to take bites out of the problem.  The Patent Quality Improvement Act is one of these bites. We're happy to see it move forward and we're in full support of Senator Schumer for taking this issue seriously. If you want, you can give him some twitter love here."
Yahoo acquires Tumblr,BradUSV,2013-05-20 16:12:50,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"Yahoo announced today that they will acquire our portfolio company Tumblr.   In September of 2007 we, together with Spark Capital, invested in a 3 person start-up founded by David Karp, a 21 year old coder who had not finished high school. At the time, our biggest challenge was convincing David to drop the four other projects he was working on to focus on Tumblr. Once he did, he quickly built one of the world's greatest platforms for self expression. Over the last five years, Tumblr became much more than that.   Today we, as users, are all overwhelmed by the amount of content available on the Internet. It is no longer enough to know what we are searching for. More and more, we need a way to discover things we did not know we were looking for. Tumblr is one of the best, if not the best platform for discovering new ideas and inspiration on the Internet. It does this by combining creation, consumption and curation in a way that remains completely unique.  David's intuitive genius for the medium built an enormous network of highly engaged users. Tumblr now has an opportunity to be the future of entertainment media, in much the same way Twitter can be the future of news. Tumblr was well on its way to becoming a large and important company, but the hard work of building a business around this huge network remained in front of us. When Yahoo expressed serious interest in Tumblr, David saw an opportunity to combine his ability to create a compelling user experience with Marissa Mayer's experience building businesses to Internet scale. Perhaps most importantly Marissa promised Yahoo ""won't screw it up"". http://bit.ly/18Y7rfy  Yahoo's acquisition of Tumblr is a very smart strategic move that will bring a new audience to Yahoo and create a real opportunity for them to balance the market power of Google and Facebook. That will be good for Yahoo and Tumblr, but it will also be good for the market broadly."
Auxmoney,johnbuttrick,2013-06-11 11:29:42,2,0,"[u'johnbuttrick', u'aweissman']","Today we are delighted to announce that we have made an investment in Auxmoney, an online credit marketplace in Germany. The CEO, Raffael Johnen was in London last week and appeared on a LeWeb panel with the CEOs of two other USV companies, Renaud Laplanche from Lending Club and Samir Desai from Funding Circle.   Like Lending Club, Auxmoney is a marketplace for consumer credit that matches consumers seeking loans with investors seeking better risk-adjusted returns than those offered by banks and other fixed income options. We have strong conviction in this business model and the power of the internet to restructure our analog financial systems.  Auxmoney was founded in 2008 by Raffael, Philipp Kriependorf and Philip Kamp and is based in Dusseldorf, Germany. Initially, the site operated much like a classified site where borrowers paid to post loan requests and investors contacted borrowers directly. Today, it is an online marketplace where qualified borrowers can post loan requests for free, and investors can invest in a broad number of loans to spread risk across borrowers.  The co-founders are serial entrepreneurs. Until USV and our friends at Index Ventures invested at the end of last year, the founders had only taken small amounts of outside capital from individual investors. The company is now well capitalized and the founders are engaged in building a scaleable marketplace, initially for the German market. We are excited to have them as partners and look forward to helping them build a large business."
Firebase,albertwenger,2013-06-20 11:54:04,2,0,"[u'albertwenger', u'mceoin']","Arthur C. Clarke famously wrote that ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" I have always had mixed feelings about this quote because as an engineer my reaction to something really advanced like self driving cars is to want to understand the science behind it. So does that mean there is no ""magic"" for engineers?  I remember first looking at Twilio and thinking it can't really be that easy to receive a phone call using a program. A couple lines of code? That's all? More recently I had the same reaction looking at Firebase. Javascript objects that are local but are synchronized over the network? Set values with a single call and receive a callback when a value changes? That's really it? In a trial a few weeks ago it took me less than an hour to turn a single player game into a two player game (and that includes signing up for Firebase and reading the documentation). Both of these are examples of a kind of magic for engineers: access to a much more powerful ""spell"" that let's you do new and amazing things.  Firebase's service arrives just at the right time because the need for synchronization has gone up tremendously. Up until fairly recently synchronization occurred entirely on the server. In a ""submit form to get to next page"" web world that was perfectly acceptable. But with today's Javascript based frontends the page reload is a thing of the past (thankfully). And to create fast mobile apps data has to be local to avoid the latency from server roundtrips, especially for small actions (e.g., marking a message as read). Firebase doesn't just handle much of this synchronization but also does so in realtime, which is particularly impressive and super useful for any type of collaboration. You can see some of the things that people have built on Firebase here.  Today we are announcing our investment in Firebase together with Flybridge Capital Partners. We are excited to be backing James, Andrew and the Firebase team as they build out their amazing service. You can read more about the financing on the Firebase blog."
SigFig,johnbuttrick,2013-07-03 10:01:09,1,0,[u'johnbuttrick'],"Investment management is an increasingly important problem. With the decline of defined benefit plans and the increasingly shaky social security system, most people will have to rely primarily on their savings and retirement accounts to fund living expenses after they stop working. But investing is complicated and time consuming, and the array of options is bewildering to most people: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, real estate partnerships, MLP's, etc.   Today we are announcing an investment in SigFig, an investment company for the digital era. The company was originally founded as Wikinvest, which gave do-it-yourself investors a resource to help them understand stocks, mutual funds and other investment products. But the founders soon realized investors needed a more fundamental resource: a service to stay on top of their own accounts.  SigFig now syncs with 100 major brokerages and allows you to easily track your investment and retirement accounts on the web and mobile devices. SigFig's algorithms will help you identify which of your investments are laggards or whether you are paying unnecessarily high fees--not something custodians and investment advisors like to highlight. The product will also keep you abreast of unusual price swings and provide other useful market information. It's a free service, you should sign up for it today.  In partnership with CNN Money and USA Today, SigFig currently analyzes more than $75 Billion in assets and those numbers are growing at a healthy clip. We think SigFig is building a strong data foundation and is developing some very interesting investment products. It's too early to say exactly what those will be, except they will be low cost, easy to understand, high quality and investor friendly. Along with our colleagues at Bain Capital Ventures, we are excited to partner with Mike and his team and we welcome them to the USV portfolio."
Transparency in Government Surveillance,nickgrossman,2013-07-18 07:35:10,4,0,"[u'nickgrossman', u'_zachary', u'sumitpaul', u'EllieAsksWhy']","Today, we have joined a large and diverse group of companies, non-profits and consumer advocates in an open letter urging the US government to allow internet and telecom companies to freely report statistics on government surveillance requests.  As we've discussed before, standing up for your users is a feature. As we all move more and more of our lives online and into our phones, the data we are producing -- and sharing, whether we know it or not -- is growing exponentially. The extent to which we can trust the services we use to steward our data appropriately is a matter of global economic importance.  At the same time, our understanding and expectations of privacy are changing quickly. We are using network analysis to solve problems on every front -- whether that's finding a cure for cancer, selling products more effectively, managing our energy consumption, or fighting crime. In every case, that means looking for patterns and connections in the vast quantities of data we produce. Our colleague Albert has argued repeatedly that we as a society need to be having an open discussion about the risks and merits of network analysis, and the tradeoffs we're willing to make in terms of privacy, innovation and security.  One thing that's clear is that we can't have that conversation in the context of vast, secret, unaccountable and unchecked surveillance programs. Rather, we need to bring more transparency and more data to the discussion.   We can start to do this by being open about the extent of data sharing between internet companies and governments. Google pioneered this approach in 2010 with their Transparency Report, and Twitter has done the same since 2012. However, it has become clear over the past month that even when a transparent relationship with their users about the use of user data is an important brand promise, companies are prevented by the government from delivering on that promise when confronted by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests and National Security Letters.  Today's letter requests that internet and telecom companies be allowed to freely publish data about the volume and character of the government surveillance requests they receive. This is a small, but reasonable and necessary step towards increasing the public dialogue around privacy, surveillance, and network analysis.

Alternative uses of quantified self data,AlexanderPease,2013-08-04 03:55:33.871000,1,0,[u'AlexanderPease'],"Starting to see some interesting alternative use cases for the impending wave of quantified self data. As more and more people start to wear Fitbits and UPs, plus we're about a year away from a slew of Kickstarter and other projects promising to track medical data on a daily basis, we'll be struggling to figure out what to do with all this data. And while it's fairly obvious, and hopefully beneficial, to use this data to improve fitness and health, HOW to do this may not be as apparent. As a musician, I like the concept of BioBeats. I know from experience (a college summer internship) that many studies have been done on certain types of music helping babies recover while in prenatal intensive care units. We're not too far away from a complete customization of that alternative therapy. And, for the rest of us, maybe it will push us to workout just that little bit harder. "

Lacy has a good point that the media (and its audience) focuses too much on the $$$ raised. In particular, she makes a case why raising capital is important for content-sites.

So if we agree that reporters and editors should be paid market rates for doing good work, and we agree that news organizations should be focused upfront on building a solid voice and audience over SEO tricks, and we agree that all of this takes time, what are the alternatives to raising capital?

It's also interesting that she think VCs should be looking at the sector more—investors are just hesitant b/c they don't scale like networks + haven't proven good returns yet.
What I'm thinking about: Are there alternatives to VC funding for these businesses? And, on a tangential note, are these businesses ""investable""—or will the future of content publishing be decentralized (not from a handful of major sources, maybe a large number of independent reporters)?"

The Internet, however, fundamentally alters this dynamic, by vastly increasing the number of distribution points as well as the number of content choices that an average person has. If one wanted to watch a movie today they could do so via Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Youtube, Vudu, Vimeo and many, many other channels. And with technologies like Chromecast and AppleTV, this list can potentially be expanded to anything that can be displayed within a web browser.
However, most of these video distribution options available today are outdated. They were designed before channels like Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook even existed. The filmmaker's role is secondary to the marketplace, and the creator has no direct relationship with the fans and customers of their product. As a result, new methods and opportunities to distribute content have opened. One of those is VHX, which has developed a service that allows creators to market and sell their goods directly to users, without any intermediary, available on any device. We are announcing today that USV has led a Series A investment in VHX.
In the same way that Tumblr created a self-serve blogging platform, VHX has created a self-serve video distribution platform - with the same ease and focus on beautiful design. Creators are in control of every element - a creator needs only to pick a theme, customize the site and upload content. No exclusivity, and no fees (just a simple revenue share). In the past year, over 300,000 people have purchased content via the VHX platform, resulting in over $2M in gross sales to the content creators. This platform empowers filmmakers by allowing them to craft the audience experience, removing the intermediaries that control how people interact and transact with their content.
Just as interesting are the new possibilities that emerge from networked use of the VHX platform. For maybe the first time, filmmakers can create ad-hoc “studios” on the fly - bundling their films to be distributed and sold together. Multiple creators can also use the tools and data that arise from the platform to band together and co-market content, again in real time and on the fly, to their joint fan bases. And, users themselves can follow and promote content within and without the network. The VHX platform increases in value to both creators and users as the participants and activities grow.
VHX’s mission is to help artists make more money from their work. We are excited to help them with that goal."

""We realized that our thesis evolves incrementally as a result of our dialogue with the market, and that the best way to manage that was to accept that we would never get to an answer, so we should just publish the conversation. The best way to do that is with a blog. So here it is.""
Now, 8 years later, USV.com is re-launching again, building on the original idea of ""having a dialogue with the market"" and ""publishing the conversation"".  This time around, we're inviting anyone who's so inclined to share links and discuss them here.
Of course, sharing links is nothing new -- from Delicious, to reddit, to Hacker News, to Twitter, chatting around shared links is as old as the social web -- it's something we do internally every day and now we're opening up that conversation.
Lots has changed since 2005, but one thing remains constant: web-enabled networks of collaborators, producers and consumers are transforming every sector. So there is still lots to talk about.
Here's to continuing that conversation, among ourselves and with all of you.

At USV we have participated in a bunch of services that make it easier to share - such as Twitter, Behance, Skillshare, Tumblr, YouNow, Foursquare, and others.
At the same time, as sharing has become more widespread, we are now seeing the emergence and growth of services aimed initially at creators themselves. Tools, intertwined with communities, to enable, assist, produce and support the act of creation itself. Services that help people create media fearlessly, and to do without costly distribution or other intermediaries. Wattpad, for creating and telling stories, is an example of this.
Today we are announcing our investment in another such service, Splice, which is designed to enhance the musical creation process.
Matt Aimonetti, Steve Martocci and team are developing a platform that is comprised of both creation and collaboration components. And just as artists today are unprecedentedly collaborative - remix culture being just one example - Splice will assist people with a set of tools inserted into the very creation process that can take music, iterate it, break it down, and fork it, as developers might do with code. After the creation process, they can then collaborate by sharing sounds, stems, components with others.
Using Splice, someone with a specific point of view about a certain genre, a certain sound, an instrument, can more easily create and share arrangements, mixes and remixes. It will give people a chance to allocate more time to that part of music creation. In this way, Splice may even expand the notion of who and what a creator is, even who a musician is. That's something we are thrilled to support."

The battle for power on the Internet: Bruce Schneier at TEDxCambridge A civil war wages for the Internet. As large institutions, like governments and corporations, try to restrict online behavior, tech-adept Internet cowboys fight for a sovereign world wide web. But if you’re not in either group, and you’re not a world-class coder, you may currently stand in the crossfire. Security expert Bruce Schneier examines your fate and offers three suggestions that could get you out of this unharmed.

The problem with “Don’t Feed the Trolls”: Steph Guthrie at TEDxToronto  As anyone who’s ever been on YouTube knows, Internet trolls are prolific. Racism and sexism are their bread and butter, and their indiscriminate vitriol has led to the blanket mantra, “Don’t feed the trolls!” Steph Guthrie calls that attitude into question. Arguing that the Internet should never be a safe place for prejudice, she urges us to reject the honorific of “troll” and treat vulgar commenters as bona fide bigots.


Can we really trust the crowd? Jens Krause at TEDxGhent  Crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, blah, blah, blah. A lot of Internet elite like to espouse the “wisdom of the crowd,” quite a few TED and TEDx speakers included. But Jens Krause has made a life of studying how crowds, or swarms, make decisions. It turns out that crowds can make terrible decisions sometimes, depending on the type of problems they’re facing. Whether you’re about to launch a big crowd-sourced project at work or simply trying to find the best place to eat tonight, his results are worth knowing."

Get embedded. Presentations are fully embeddable. Slides contain your images, text and video – no matter where hosted. Own and control your distribution.
Get linked. Presentations contain fully customizable bylines. Link to your squeeze page from your viral conference keynote. Manage your lead pipeline.

How can you and your clients use it? 

Presenters: Add fully-embeddable presentations to your posts and pages, then anywhere else using a slide-specific (meaning that slide will show up first) code.

Are We in the Blow-Off Phase of Bubble 2.0?,kidmercury,2013-10-16 15:30:13.679000,3,0,"[u'kidmercury', u'HarrisonWeber', u'nickgrossman']","Folks may remember the much publicized beef between Steve Blank and Ben Horowitz regarding whether or not bubble 2.0 was real or not. In that beef, one of the points Blank made was that there are four phases to every speculative bubble: stealth, awareness, mania, and blow-off. 
 I think stealth must have been 2004-2006, awareness, 2007-2009, mania 2010-2011, and blow-off is 2012-2013. Though Facebook has bounced back from its IPO sell-off, that there was a sell-off itself is indicative of a speculative sell-off. When we look at what else is occurring in the sector, we see Zynga, Groupon, Yelp struggling with share price and accounting issues coming to light; on the private side, we see a bunch of companies struggling with valuations on their next round. I think the Twitter IPO will be the capstone on the blow-off phase, and thus fully conclude the saga of Bubble 2.0.....

A little A/B testing happening?
As an example, if developing and exposing discussion/community is the goal, what about a variation where highly rated *comments* roll into the front page, in addition to posts? Draw people in not just by link title, but by what's actually being discussed?
On the one hand, USV has a few other time commitments that probably take precedence; on the other, if the site is a kind of expression of the ideas that drive the firm, perhaps time spent refining that expression would pay off in other ways.

There is one place where the movement from complexity to simplicity has not taken place yet - databases. In fact, over the last decade database software has become increasingly complex - numerous niche tools have emerged and the market has become highly fragmented.  
Today there is an opportunity to reign in the complexity and make it simple again. Orchestrate.io does for databases, what Amazon did for servers, and what the iPhone did for the numerous devices we carried. Orchestrate simplifies databases by turning multiple types of databases into a single interface that we run as a service.

We then ﬁnd that lower bilateral trust leads to less trade between two countries, less portfolio investment, and less direct investment, even after controlling for the characteristics of the two countries.

But we live in a time that requires leaders with a combination of these talents. Leaders who not only possess strategic foresight and analytic skills, but also see every business challenge as a design problem—solvable with the right mix of imagination and metrics.
We call these new leaders DEOs, short for Design Executive Officer and a play on CEO. Just as we took our cues from MBAs and the military in casting the ideal CEO of the 20th century, we can look to designers—in that term’s broadest definition— to model the leadership traits we need now.
DEOs are not necessarily design practitioners, but they possess characteristics, behaviors, and mindsets that designers commonly use to innovate in unpredictable, fast-moving, and value-charged conditions.
Startup founders, and a growing number of progressive corporate leaders who emulate them, have learned to lead using these abilities. They realize their success rests on attracting and coalescing stakeholders who share their vision, goals and values. Traditional “command and control” directives don’t work for them, nor do strategies focused too intently on bottom-line profitability. Instead they must build appealing corporate cultures that attract and retain talented employees. They must assemble teams who collaborate easily and effectively. They must create resilient organizations that value expertise but make room for failure—organizations able to evolve with the changes taking place all around them.
Do you have the traits of a DEO? If you can honestly answer “yes” to most of the questions below, you possess the key characteristics of a next-generation leader:
1. Are you comfortable taking risks on a regular basis? DEOs embrace risk as an inherent part of life and a key ingredient of creativity. Rather than avoiding or minimizing it, DEOs seek greater ease and command of it. They recast risk as experimentation and invite collaborators. Chris Anderson, curator of the wildly popular TED phenomenon, endorses this wholeheartedly. In our book, Rise of the DEO: Leadership by Design, Chris urges leaders to “embrace the chaos and just realize that we’re in a time when an element of letting go can be unbelievably powerful.”
2. Do you look forward to making changes in your company, your industry or yourself? DEOs aren’t troubled by change; in fact, they openly promote and encourage it. DEOs regard the ability to change quickly as a competitive advantage and seek opportunities to use it. They love to experiment and iterate their way to an improvement. They try to think and act differently than others, and are comfortable disrupting the status quo if it stands in the way of their dream.
3. Are you able to problem solve in a systematic manner? Despite their desire to take risks and make change, DEOs are systems thinkers who understand the interconnectedness of their world. They know that each part of their organization overlaps and influences another. They respect the unseen connections that surround what’s visible and take these into consideration when solving problems.
4. Can you integrate intuitive and analytic decision-making? DEOs know that the best decisions are informed by both intuitive and analytic analysis. A DEO can intuitively sense when something’s wrong, then use assessment tools to figure out where the problem lies. He or she can analyze broad opportunities in the market, then use intuition to discern elusive, but crucial specifics.
5. Can you easily empathize and connect with others? DEOs have a highly refined social intelligence. They instinctively connect with others and integrate them into well-defined and heavily accessed networks. They prefer spending time with employees, customers, and strangers rather than equipment, plants, or spreadsheets. “Everyday people” are a source of strength, renewal, and new ideas. This benefits them personally, but also has a positive impact on their bottom line. Famed restaurateur, Jesse Ziff Cool—another leader profiled in our book—explains the simple equation she follows: “If I take good care of my staff, then they’ll take good care of everything else.”
6. Are you driven to take action? DEOs feel an urgency to get personally involved, to understand details through their own interaction, and to lead by example. They understand the risk of too much inventiveness or too much deliberation, and they know that no innovation has a chance of success until it leaves the building.  They become adept at prioritizing and focusing on key tasks, and they often end discussions with “What’s our deadline?”
Our book, Rise of the DEO: Leadership by Design, identifies and explores the qualities ­ and virtues of this new breed of leaders. It describes the skills they use to collaborate and the conditions they construct to support creativity. We profile business heads who exemplify this new ideal and show how they and their companies have benefited from this approach. As with the DEOs we admire, this book combines well-researched data with beautifully imagined, thoughtfully presented insights. It is designed to inspire, inform and encourage everyone who’s interested in solving problems and making change."
How JBoss did it,databigbang,2013-10-17 21:09:17.859000,1,0,[u'databigbang'],"JBoss was an Open Source company providing free middleware software to it’s customers. By the end of 2003, JBoss had been downloaded 5 million times, and the company was doing about $1m a year in revenues, selling training, documentation and consulting. Around that time, Bob Bickel joined the company, and initiated a process to raise venture capital. The raising of VC funds was a trigger that was needed to hire a professional management team, and to enter a new growth phase. Together with Bob, the company had figured out that once an application migrated from development to production, they could charge their customers for a subscription based initially around support, that should result in a better monetization than the other revenue streams.

To Search or to Ask: The Routing of Information Needs  Between Traditional Search Engines and Social Networks,databigbang,2013-10-17 21:35:26.565000,1,0,[u'databigbang'],"In status message question asking (SMQA), members of  social networking sites make use of status messages to  express information needs to friends and contacts. We  present findings from a laboratory study that examined 82  participants’ SMQA behaviors in the broader context of  online information seeking. When given the option of using  a search engine and/or a social network, participants  leveraged SMQA for 20% of their information needs, most  often posing a question to their network in addition to  issuing a query. We show the important roles played by the  specificity of the information need and the perceived  audience of a given network on routing decisions. We then  demonstrate that routing decisions have varied effects on  participants’ satisfaction, information value, and trust of  outcomes. Our  findings suggest that search engines can better address a  meaningful portion of people’s information needs by  integrating SMQA capabilities into their systems."
DragonBox secretly teaches algebra to children,databigbang,2013-10-17 21:48:08.392000,1,0,[u'databigbang'],"I received good real feedback about it and since we need more creative ways for teaching/learning this is a good share:
As every math teacher or parent knows, teaching algebra can be difficult. Before students even enter the classroom they are filled with negative thoughts about algebra. It’s hard. It’s boring. It sucks! There are hundreds of tweets every hour talking about how much people hate algebra.
Unfortunately, algebra is also the biggest hurdle students must clear before learning more advanced mathematics in university or beyond.
This is why we created DragonBox. We want to remove the negativity surrounding algebra by making it as simple as possible to understand and learn algebra´s big ideas, with or without help, at your own pace.
This is not about creating a game, an educational app, or using technology or tablets in the classroom.
It is about listening to the students and creating the best possible resource to learn algebra from a student's perspective."

Education is the most traditional means with formative effect on the human mind, learning and memory being its fundamental support. For this reason, it is essential to find different strategies to improve the studentś performance. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that a novel experience could exert an enhancing effect on learning and memory within the school environment. Here we show that novel experience improved the memory of literary or graphical activities when it is close to these learning sessions. We found memory improvements in groups of students who had experienced a novel science lesson 1 hour before or after the reading of a story, but not when these events were 4 hours apart. Such promoting effect on long-term memory (LTM) was also reproduced with another type of novelty (a music lesson) and also after another type of learning task (a visual memory). Interestingly, when the lesson was familiar, it failed to enhance the memory of the other task."

"Tech Startups to Veterans: We Love You, We Want Some More of Ya",billmcneely,2013-10-22 13:18:27.152000,2,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'br_ttany']","After a slow start, the Tech community has come to realize that veterans can be effective tech entrepreneurs and facilitators. Graduates of TechStars Patriot Boot Camp, StartupWeekend, VictorySpark,andIncline are now program managers, HackStars class participants in accelerators/incubators. Not to mention, 2 veteran founded startups being acquired in the last 12-18 months.
Just 3 years ago this was not the case and much hand wringing was occuring over veteran unemployment. Non-profits advocating for veterans, government officials and to a lesser extent, the Fortune 500, were bantering about many well intention, but half -baked solutions. The Tech Crowd with the exception of Craig Newmark, was not even apart of the veteran unemployment discussion.
Most of the early conversation focused on the poor translation of military skills to plain English that civilian employers could easily understand. More effort is being put forth educating military alumni on job search subjects such as writing an effective resume, how to do a phone interview, sourcing job leads, dressing for the interview etc. However this only addresses the here and now of the veteran unemployment equation.
Up until late Summer of 2011 the discourse seemed to have more of charity overtone to it. The thinking seemed to be veterans are entitled to jobs merely because they fought for our country regardless of individual capability. A small minority of veterans seemed to think they were entitled as well. On LinkedIn I have seen my share of posts that blast civilian hiring managers who don’t hire vets while arguing for front of the line privileges in the federal employment process.
Thankfully the discourse seemed to change from an emphasis on charity and entitlement to one of getting the most out of our investment in today’s young people. As part of Time magazine’s cover package entitled The New Greatest Generation Rajiv Srinivasanadvocates in his piece that causes that are presented as a charity get treated as such, with interest fading with time, causes that get pitched as investments are taken much more seriously and have legs that can run the marathon that is a career.
As part of treating our veterans as an investment in our future we need to acknowledge that the biggest factor in veteran long term unemployment is the lack of education whether in the form of a degree or a certification program
An April 26, 2011 Tech Crunch article stated despite triple the education resources in the new GI Bill, less than 6% of military men and women use their complete education benefits and only 25% complete the degrees they start.
Of the 6% of former military men and women who do use their GI Bill, a significant number are earning their degree through for-profit schools. The concern here is that veterans are not being properly counseled toward a degree plan that will lead to a viable career path that is the right fit for the individual. The emphasis is on profit and not the long term career goals of the student. Approximately $1B of the $4B of GI Bill funds paid out last year ended up in the hands of just 8 schools as reported by Bloomberg BusinessWeek.
Many veterans who do take advantage of their GI Bill benefits are the first members of their families to attend college. That’s ok. Just like the settlers in the 1800’s who headed out west for better opportunity, these veterans often joined the military with the goal of in mind of improving their lot in life. Unfortunately they don’t have the same support system I had when I first left the service in the mid 90’s. I had a multitude of professionally successful, college educated friends and family I could rely on for advice and encouragement. I could ask:
· What criteria should I use to choose the university to attend?
· How should I schedule my classes and which professors teaching style best suites my learning style?
· How many hours should I work at an outside job?
· What kind of job I could get with a Criminal Justice degree as oppose to a business degree?
· What are the ramifications of taking a general business degree as oppose to a finance degree?
Should I immediately complete an MBA instead of earning a commission and going back in the service?
The veteran who does not have the support system that I had may fail if they have to figure it out on their own.
This is where veteran friendly, education startup companies like Uvize come into play. Uvize (‘12 Tech Stars PBC & ‘13 Kaplan EdTech) provides personalized academic preparation and coaching for college bound military veterans. Uvize is looking to decrease the crazy 88% attrition rate of freshman veterans. That’s a failure rate 8% higher than that of BUD/S, the qualifying course for SEALS!
As if the lack of a formal education isn't bad enough, possessing the wrong skill set is even worse. This became evident to me while screening candidates while filling a position one of our clients at Hello I’m Logistics. I asked each candidate why they picked the degree they did. An overwhelming number of responses ran along the lines of wanting to “check the block” on a job application. Having a criminal justice degree is ok if you are looking at law enforcement career but that degree however does not give you the background needed to land a logistics management position.
A few days ago I was reading a post by Mark Suster, a celebrity venture capitalist , concerning an investment he made in an online education company called Tree House . During the course of outlining his thesis behind making the investment, Mr. Suster has this to say about education in America
One of the biggest problems I see with our university system is that we’re graduating too many people from 4-year universities who have the wrong skillset and come out owing large sums of money. I call them “indentured servants” because they come out of college already having an anchor around their necks.
If you have spent the last 3 or 4 years taking courses online or in the classroom while holding down a full time job (either inside or outside the military) while raising a family be sure your effort and your dollars will provide the outcome you desire.
It is entirely possible veterans may not know what different careers are out there. So veterans may just pick a course of study that their friends are following. 4 years later they are walking across a stage to accept their degree. 6 months on the job they realize they don’t like what they are doing after exhausting their GI Bill benefits.
As part of the transition process out of the military HR professionals from Fortune 500 firms from banking, manufacturing, logistics/supply chain, IT, and the trades sectors (to name only few) should be incentivized to share information about their sector to veterans. I am not talking about $5,000 or $6,000 tax credit I am talking something of substance north of $10M a year in order to pay salaries of top notch folks, training aids, constructing buildings the like.
No matter how much we complain about how manufacturing jobs paying middle class wages have migrated overseas, it will never bring them back to the United States. For that matter, well paying Services related jobs are on the way out as well. The US Economy is firmly a knowledge based one in the second decade of the 21st century.
Encouraging veterans to enter fields such as renewable energy, healthcare, engineering and IT that require a firm understanding of science and math is a must. We must educate veterans, especially those that are under age 35, that there are more career options outside the military than defense contracting. Defense contracting is a short term, old man’s game. It’s not meant to offer a viable, sustainable, family friendly career path. The “Get Rich or Die Trying” mantra only works for the likes of 50 Cent.
Encouraging our young men and women to learn a portable skill such as computer programming, even if it’s outside of a traditional university environment is a winning strategy. Udemy , Khan AcademyTree House and Incline are excellent online outlets for learning and are well suited for the tech savvy youth of today.
Although the US job market is experiencing a 7.6% unemployment rate, technology firms located in San Francisco, Austin, Boston, Boulder and Seattle have programming positions open for months due the dearth of qualified candidates. While I was working on Hello I’m, I spoke with two tech firm founders in the LA and San Francisco area and both don’t understand why more young people are not skating to the where the puck is .
Getting an education in a field that provides both career fulfillment while also allowing us to provide a reasonable quality of life for our families does not have to be an either / or proposition. Investing in yourself is a risky venture, not just a simple color by number process. Don’t just make decisions…. Make GREAT decisions.
If we all do this, then we will surely see the number of veteran founded companies and along with founding team members, grow on AngelList."

Memes and brands come from anyplace, really — and sometimes, they almost don’t happen at all.
The iconic canine head tilt will always be with us, in one format or another, although the means of production will change as surely as the gramophone gave way to iTunes.
Here is the story of how the first baroo was created as a tribute and offered as a brand identity — and the journey across space and time from an 1898 painting of a dog listening to a gramophone to the prosh redonkulousness of Cute Overload .
Back in the late 19th century, a painter made a portrait of his loyal little dog transfixed by a voice recording, and pitched it to an audio technology startup as a piece of brand DNA.
It was summarily rejected at the first meeting: “Dogs don’t listen to phonographs.”
But success came after time and iterations: Victor Talking Machine Company made Nipper its mascot; RCA followed, and the first baroo went on to worldwide fame in a reign that lasted decades.
“It is difficult to say how the idea came to me beyond that fact that it suddenly occurred to me that to have my dog listening to the phonograph, with an intelligent and rather puzzled expression, and call it ‘His Master’s Voice’ would make an excellent subject. We had a phonograph and I often noticed how puzzled he was to make out where the voice came from. It certainly was the happiest thought I ever had.” — Francis Barraud, Nipper’s portrait painter and friend.
And that is the story of a meme that started a century ago, spread across media and continents, beginning as a painting and incarnated today as videos, blog post, and page after scrolling page of images."

In a word: STOP!!!!
In Jerry Colonna’s post The Crucible of Leadership points out that in order to be successful as a leader/manager you have to be comfortable with yourself and your approach to life. If you are trying to be something you are not, your co-workers and subordinates will see right through that. They will know you are not authentic and you will lose your effectiveness.
I learned this important lesson for myself as a 25 year old Platoon Leader in the Army during the initial invasion of Iraq (OIF I) in 2003. The battalion I was assigned to had not been to the field to train much as whole, only in slices. I arrived on the scene 2 weeks before deployment orders had been issued and knew no one well. I had been in the military having been enlisted in the Navy, Marine Corps and Army but I had not been in a position of responsibility. So I had not had a chance to form own solidify my leadership style in my own head.
My company commander on the other hand had. He had been loaned out from logistics the 82nd Airborne Division as an infantry officer. On the outside, very loud, loved to hold court and was seemingly hard charging. He knew how to talk the talk. He would very often try distorting reality by berating troops until they agreed with his viewpoint or his version of the facts.
He appeared he everything together so without realizing it I started trying to emulate him.
After a few months in Iraq I started leading different days and weeks long missions separate from the company, my Company Commander was not present so I reverted back to my natural state. Which is being more reserved, analytical, in those days physically fit , well spoken and focused on tactics and planning missions/projects.
When the platoon returned to the company area I would revert back to trying to be like my company commander. My troops started to realize I was doing this Dr Jekyle and Mr Hyde routine.
One day, one of my troops walked up to me one day and said “Sir, be yourself. You see you get the results you need when you are yourself and you see you don’t when you are not” So I took his advice and was myself the rest of the deployment. At times it was painful when interacting with my boss, but I held the line.
After 9 months, my Company Commander was relieved of duty (my boss was fired) and so was our First Sergeant (top enlisted soldier in the company). Subsequently they both went through proceedings where charges related to loss of accountability of millions of dollars of equipment, abuse of subordinates and unauthorized personal weapons on the battlefield resulted in their leadership roles, fines, loss of rank and career progression.
Had I not been an authentic leader/manager and demonstrated ethics and morals my parents and the Army had taught me I am sure I would have suffered the same fate."

100% Renewable Energy: Is It Possible?,solarfeeds,2013-10-23 17:19:37.977000,1,4,[u'solarfeeds'],"100% renewable energy to some may sound like nothing more than a pipe dream, but in reality, it already exists.  As giant countries like China, America, & India continue to pump out never ending streams of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, small, low-elevation islands are at risk of serious damage from rising sea levels and more intense and frequent storms.  But some islands refuse to surrender and are doing everything in their capacity to do their part, even if that means overhauling their electricity grid as a means to achieve 100% clean, renewable energy.  Of course this transition does not only contribute towards a healthier planet, but also a lower fuel bill for the islands as it is expensive to purchase and receive diesel and other fuels by sea or air.
Tokelau

You may not have heard of the small island of Tokelau before, but its 1,500 inhabitants live on three atolls in the South Pacific where the maximum height above sea level is less than 17 feet.  At the Durban Climate Conference in 2011, the Head of the Government of Tokelau, Foua Toloa, declared that his nation would be powered completely by renewable energy by 2012.  By October of that year, Tokelau had fulfilled its goal.
Prior to the 2012 conversion to clean energy, the island was dependent on three diesel-powered generators (one on each atoll) that burned 200 liters of fuel a day and cost the country nearly $800,000 on an annual basis.  Furthermore, Tokelauans only had access to electricity between 15-18 hours each day, hardly the recipe for progress and growth.  Now, with their solar panels and batteries for storage when the Sun isn’t shining, Tokelau can now produce 150% of its electrical need; not only are carbon emissions and costs reduced, but energy is more accessible than ever before.  During prolonged periods of lack of sunshine, coconut oil can be used as fuel to mitigate any solar weakness.  Excess coconut oil is sold to faster offset the purchase of the solar panels.
 
El Hierro

El Hierro is an island located at the western edge of Spain’s Canary Islands that has forsaken fossil fuels in favor of the plentiful renewable energy sources that bless the island.  With a dormant volcano, strong breezes, and abundant sunshine to draw from, El Hierro uses water, wind, and fire to power itself to self-sufficiency.  Much larger than Tokelau, the island has more than 10,000 residents and formerly emitted some 18,200 tons of carbon dioxide each year.  That is however, until El Hierro built wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) panels and hydroelectric sources to replace the need for polluting.
 
Samsø

The Danish island of Samsø was actually the first island in the world to become completely powered by renewable energy.  In 1997, the island won a government sponsored competition to become a model renewable energy community and since then has added 21 wind turbines to fulfill the electricity needs of the approximately 4,000 residents.  Of the 21 turbines that belong to the island twice the size of Manhattan, residents own a share in 20 of them.  Soren Hermansen, one of the leading proponents of wind power in the area, addressed the critique that wind turbines are unsightly or noisy with the response, “If you own a share in a wind turbine it looks better, it sounds better.  It sounds like money in the bank.”  It’s difficult to argue with that.
Though it would require a great investment of capital and effort, transitioning to a 100% clean energy world is possible, and as we can see, it has already begun.  We at Mosaic firmly agree with Mr. Hermansen that giving people a stake in their clean energy will help to accelerate its advancement.  It is for this reason we seek to enable as many people as possible to invest and take part in the clean energy movement while generating true prosperity."

The general gist of the article was if Boulder’s perceived left leaning political stance was unwelcoming to first time military veteran entrepreneurs and what could be done to change that viewpoint. What I saw missing from this article and from other coverage of the Hotness that is Veteran Entrepreneurship (Shaun Ho of Ironsighting, his words not mine ) are ways veterans, who are not former officers from Ivy League or Military Academy institutions with MBAs (read: the boys from TroopSwap orFidelis ) can prepare themselves to enter the startup community. Here are a few suggestions:
Bring with you the leadership, interpersonal skills, adaptability. teamwork, physical fitness and core values you learned in the military.
Remember your public speaking and PowerPoint skills. These will come in handy for pitch decks and pitch days
Leave behind, at or with the VA Hospital, therapist or significant other war stories, mental anguish, employment and money issues.

This paper boldly challenges the long established misconception that the catastrophic failure of expensive software projects is detrimental to society.  Historical analysis of bureaucracies such as the Australian Tax Office shows that massive software automation has not increased their real efficiency since the 1950s.  Any increase in the efficiency of individual workers has simply been consumed by increased bureaucratic complexity, as predicted by Parkinson's law.   As the primary net effect of software is to facilitate bureaucratic complexity it is therefor essential that software projects fail if society is to function effectively.  In this way the heavy burden of guilt can be lifted from the shoulders of the numerous project managers that have subconsciously devoted their careers to ensuring that projects rarely, if ever, succeed.

What I Learned from the TechStars Patriot Bootcamp Experience,billmcneely,2013-10-24 11:47:21.064000,2,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'nickgrossman']","This past week I was fortunate enough to have been able to attend the 2013 TechStars Patriot Boot Camp on the George Washington University campus in Washington, DC.
I learned several lessons that encompassed the whole experience, not just the three days I spent in our nation’s capital.
Develop and Invest in Social Media Relationships
Back in 2009 I could see that the Iraq and Afghan wars were going to wrap up eventually and with it the defense contracting opportunities. So I decided to start my first business (http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100401/war-zone-start-up.html) it was about the same time that Twitter was taking off. Social networks looked as if it people in the Western world would be leveraging them just as real life relationships play out in the Middle East so that’s how I proceeded. I asked questions, shared information in the form of links, offered opinions and introduced one person to another etc. I slowly built my network to over 1,300 first line connections across Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and various blog platforms over the last 4 years.
In regards to the TechStars PBC application I have been told by multiple individuals that each recommended me for the program. Each individual came from my Social network.
If Multiple People See Your Potential ,Pursue An Opportunity, No Matter the Obstacles
As I said, multiple individuals recommended me for the program but I was not going to apply. Since I returned from my last contracting job in Iraq, my life has been like a bad country song. My family has lost our home, cars, bank account and I did stint in the VA hospital for PTSD after a suicide attempt etc. so I really did not have the money to attend.
Only after John Hrivnak contacted me did I apply because I felt I owed all those people who put themselves out for me something. Accomplishing something bigger than self is a strong motivator. Sounds familiar eh?
If You Want Success You Can Get Really Creative and Resourceful
To raise the $790 for the event I elected to use crowdfunding siteRepayVets over a 2 week period. Again, I went back to my network posting to Facebook , LinkedIn and sending out Tweets. This resulted in 2021 views with 7 contributions totaling $820. A special thanks toTim Falls and SendGrid for a super generous contribution!
To get the best price on airlines I reached out to Andrew Hyde to get a last minute ticket from Dallas to DC for $350.
I used AirBnB to rent someone’s couch for $67 for a 4 night stay.
To get around Washington DC I used the Metro and put out $30 for 4 days of travel.
Don’t Forget to Prepare to Learn
Prepare by reading. Read the suggested books. In our case Do More Faster by David Cohen and Brad Feld Look up the mentors LinkedIn profiles and read their latest blogs. Join the TechStars PBC Facebook page. All this preparation will help you select the mentors that will best help your business be successful.
Go to the Event with Something
Go to the event with a one page write up of your idea, a pitch deck or better yet a MVP version of your website. I suggest TheFunded.com or VentureHacks for ideas on verbal pitches or pitch decks.
Be In the Moment, Be In the Moment, Be In the Moment
The people you will be be meeting are amazing. We had talks by:

Senator Tim Kaine VA (D)
GEN George Casey, Former Chief of Staff of the Army
Aneesh Chopra, Former CTO of the United States
Todd Park, Current CTO of the United States
Peter Levin, Former Veteran Affairs CTO
Steve Blank, Lean Startup Fame
David Mandell, Pivot Desk
Ramsey McGrory, CEO of AddThis
David Cass,Uvise

It’s ok to snap a picture and then post later. Soak in everything the speakers are saying and just enjoy being there. Put down the phone, close up the laptop and put away the tablet. I also recommend just striking up random conversations. I learned a lot about the Roosevelt Island Project in NYC by doing this.
I Needed to Adjust Fire Concerning My Business
http://startupguru.tv was a good idea but had several scalibility issues. Namely potential copyright and royalty payment issues. It was also a niche play and the best way to monetize a media agregator is through ad revenue. Something that is not reasonable until you hit 100K visitors. 30-50K visitors sounded more plausiable and the only way to monetize at that level was a subscription based service but would be a push due the free content angle.
So I decided over the weekend it would be best to use the videos as a feature that kept visitors on the site longer and turn my main focus on to reviewing tools like MailChimp, Haiku, Context.IO etc that startups need to run their businesses.
Wrapping up, I would like to thank Taylor McLeMore for all his hard work this past week in putting this event together. You did a great job and we all grew as entrepreneurs because of your efforts."

Pattern recognition, data visualization, information processing are the recounting of stories. Facebook timelines, Twitter streams, LinkedIn updates, Google searches and results, much like reality TV, are stories, too. Stock charts and analyses, financial ratios and credit ratings, research reports, are variations, commentaries, stories about stories, and so on. Journalistic content and entertainment product, often interchangeable, are stories unabashedly, if previously listed examples are maybe less self-aware. When an entrepreneur pitches a venture capitalist, a story is told much like a filmmaker pitching a studio chief. In turn, investors tell stories to explain the risk that’s taken. When we speak about a new era of information, a new economy based on information flow and connectivity, we are speaking about a world of stories."

He pointed out that these differences are not superficial and that in the past major differences in applications platforms, like the transition from DOS to Windows have led to significant restructuring of big markets. He argued that we are in the midst of a new transition away from the browser and back to stand alone mobile applications and that this transition, like the ones before it, is the catalyst for the emergence of a new category of mobile centric companies like Instagram, Snapchat, and Rovio.
 
Bill goes on to explain why the companies that dominate the browser based world have such a hard time navigating this platform transition. It is not just that there are new tools to learn and multiple platforms to support, the design goals are fundamentally different. Mobile apps, because of the limited screen real estate and the limited patience of users, must be quick, responsive, and very tightly focused. As he puts it “mobile values the single solution, the one sharp blade rather than a Swiss army knife”. Acquiring users is also different. On the Web almost every activity starts with a search. On mobile devices, users are much more likely to dive in by launching an app. The profound consequence of this is that Search Engine Optimization which heavily influences web design has a much smaller impact on design or marketing choices in mobile.
 
Because it is so difficult for established organizations, even modern flexible ones, to navigate a transition like this, we are always on the look out for young companies that have built big networks in important markets with a mobile first approach.
 
THE Football App has done just that. We were introduced to them last spring and were able to watch as they added 3,000,000 new downloads over the last six months for a total today of over 10,000,000. It is now a category leading app with top app store positions in 50 countries. It is one of the largest mobile applications for passionate fans of the world’s most popular sport - football (Soccer for you Americans). THE Football App delivers minute-by-minute scores, news, videos, and stats for over 100 leagues, in seven languages.
 
If you are a football fan, you know the sport has no shortage of media coverage on television, in print and on the web, but that coverage is balkanized. Most outlets cover one or two leagues, and one national team. Today, the sport is more global than ever, fans want to follow players from their national teams as they move from league to league around the world. THE Football App is the only app with that kind of breadth, and yet because of its focus on one sport, it is that “single sharp blade” that Bill referred to. With the recent integration of live commentary from Twitter, the views of top Football journalists and bloggers, and everyday users, the app is poised to become the center of the global conversation about any match, news item, or celebrity in the world of football.

"I gave this talk in Detroit on peer networks and ""community capitalism."" Help me make it better.",bwats,2013-10-24 18:59:33.364000,7,4,"[u'bwats', u'nickgrossman', u'daualset', u'stanleyyork', u'fredwilson', u'rcarzo', u'br_ttany']","Here are the slides from a talk that I gave in Detroit earlier this week. It's the first attempt at a deck to inspire people to think about building (and participating) in peer networks - for bringing together business and social good. 
I titled the presentation ""Community Capitalism"" and the term ""Community Capitalist"" to highlight the idea that making money and doing good can be one in the same.
IMO, Detroit is a great place to think about these questions. Many of the entrepreneurs in Detroit aspire to make a difference within their community through commerce, but they don't know how to do so with scale.
The first half is the ""macro"" argument - that networks can change how we think of ""work"" and by tapping into them, we can solve difficult social problems. The second half are ""micro"" suggestions -  how one can get going to bootstrap a network. (Interestingly, the base of these suggestions came from an article with tips to manage a city in the 21st century. Organizing a peer network is like urban planning.)
I think the presentation is about 70% of where it needs to be - if you have any comments please add them below.
Some outstanding thoughts:

While I like ""Community Capitalism"" as an idea, I hate that it suggests that VCs (and investors) are the only ones capitalizing from the success of these networks. Eventually, I would like to add the conversation of T-Corps [USV.com link], but the goal of this presentation is not to get into questions of governance - but to convince people to think of building and participating in networks and peer communities.

And a disclaimer:

I'm missing some image attribution - that will be updated soon. All icons are from the Noun Project.

Enterprise Tech Startup: Unleashing of the Frustrated Middle Manager,billmcneely,2013-10-25 11:46:53.733000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"Most often in the tech press you find startups like Facebook started by a 20 something boy genius being highlighted. What you don’t find often is a startup solving a problem for the enterprise by someone younger. I would venture most do not have a lot of experience inside larger companies and understand their pain points and how to address them.
For instance, If you are preparing a response to a logistics request for proposal (RFP) you might need an individual from business development, transportation, warehousing , inventory control, human resources and accounting to get involved in the process. These individuals may be in different location and time zones. You could have each individual email their piece of the pie to the proposal lead to assemble taking the chance the wrong version gets published in the document and you over or under bid for the business. If you are not the project manager or business development manager you don’t see how all the pieces fit together. It’s these managers that will have the thought “let me create a piece of software where everybody can assess one document and update in real time to write client ready piece”. I am sure that is how SharePoint came about.
The Dallas startup scene is different from the Valley in this regard. There are lots of old line Fortune 500 companies. Which mean enterprise problems that need to be fixed in order for middle managers to get promoted. Sometimes political reindeer games at these places get in the way of the innovation being proposed and the middle managers leave to become startup founders. These folks are older. 30 is the Valley’s 20. 40 year olds are not endangered animals at incubators/accelerators such as Tech Wildcatters. Oh yeah, Tech Wildcatters investment thesis IS B2B."

MediaCrossing Aims To Shake Up Online Advertising,_trendspotter,2013-10-25 15:02:17.825000,1,0,[u'_trendspotter'],"
The hottest trend in online advertising today is the rapid automation of ad sales through exchanges like those run by Google, Yahoo , and Facebook . This so-called programmatic trading works something like equities trading on a stock exchange like the Nasdaq, and it’s growing like crazy.
But to Bill Lederer‘s mind, the job was never finished. Lederer, former CEO of early e-commerce company Art.com and executive at the WPP -owned media, marketing, and data services firm Kantar, has just announced a $6 million Series A round of funding for a new company, MediaCrossing, that he claims will do just that. In the process, it also could disrupt a lot of existing players in the online ad business, from Google and Facebook to a raft of ad tech companies.

There’s something about technology that actually solves a problem. All you have to see is a demo, and then it burrows into your imagination and nags at you until you own it — particularly in times when it would have been convenient. So yesterday, as I was supposed to be filing a story about the launch of a new app called Cover, I couldn’t help but wish I not only had the time to write it, but that I actually had it on my phone.
(...) it’s the first demo that’s made me think about wanting an Android phone. And considering this is something that three guys built in a matter of six months… well, let’s just say I’m keeping my eye on Cover.

The Power of Conviction,mikecollett,2013-10-25 19:30:18.476000,3,2,"[u'mikecollett', u'aweissman', u'nickgrossman']"," Conviction is a two-way street. Without it, investors and founding teams will not succeed, and both groups are searching for it in each other.
Founders are looking for excited investors who understand their vision straight away. Great startups don’t need just money – they want fit. Right out of the gate, does this investor align with our vision of where we’re going? Investors best speak with their feet, and founders need to see that they fit within an investor’s current community of startups. Founders want evidence that they can draft off an investor’s past work or expertise in a certain sector. They want to know they can leverage deep relationships an investor can bring to their specific vertical.
Investors are looking for jacked-up founders who are passionate about solving a market pain-point they feel burdened to fix. Startup teams that are sold out for their vision, however wacky it might sound, are at the top of any investor’s list. If no one is following you, then you aren’t a leader, and successful founders naturally attract teams due to their energy, determination and tenacity.
You don’t need conviction to state the obvious. Conviction is a muscle that needs daily exercise, and must be built and tested over time. When a founder and investor get together with similar views that others cannot see about how to dramatically change a certain friction-filled corner of the world, sparks will fly. The more contrarian the view and bigger the disruption, the more need for conviction.
Here’s the kicker: when two like-minded parties like this get together, it doesn’t take months to get to a handshake. The process is fast, and diligence is all about the discipline of making sure everyone checks out.
So investors and founders alike: you can’t fake conviction. You are a believer or you or not. Find something you believe in, and own it. Anything less and you are just wasting your (and others’) time."

From 2014, a USB cable will be able to provide power to bigger electronic devices. In the long term this could change the way homes and offices use electricity, cutting costs and improving efficiency.
The big change next year will be a new USB PD (Power Delivery) standard, which brings much more flexibility and ten times as much oomph: up to 100 watts.
That could presage a much bigger shift, reviving the cause of direct current (DC) as the preferred way to power the growing number of low-voltage devices in homes and offices.

Data gathered from Google’s self-driving Prius and Lexus cars shows that they are safer and smoother when steering themselves than when a human takes the wheel, according to the leader of Google’s autonomous-car project. Chris Urmson made those claims today at a robotics conference in Santa Clara, California. He presented results from two studies of data from the hundreds of thousands of miles Google’s vehicles have logged on public roads in California and Nevada.
One of those analyses showed that when a human was behind the wheel, Google’s cars accelerated and braked significantly more sharply than they did when piloting themselves. Another showed that the cars’ software was much better at maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead than the human drivers were. “We’re spending less time in near-collision states,” said Urmson. “Our car is driving more smoothly and more safely than our trained professional drivers.”

Early-Stage Military Veteran Startups Are Trending,billmcneely,2013-10-26 11:37:37.165000,2,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'nickgrossman']","RideScout launched in DC yesterday with a recent $1.35 million funding round. Its founders are Army veterans.
Unite Us recently completed a $2 million round of funding and will launch this fall. Its co-founders come from the US Air Force, Army and Marine Corps.
HirePurpose has raised $750,000, is projected to earn $200,000 in revenue in Q3. Its co-founder and CEO is a Marine Corp veteran.
Scout Ventures is on its second venture capital fund with a target size of $25MM. Its founding partner is an Army veteran.
Hivers and Strivers is a mid-atlantic angel group. Its members are comprised of US military veterans and they only invest in veteran-led start-ups.
I can go on, but I’m sure you get the point.
Since I started this blog last year, I’ve seen a steady rise in both veteran-founded startups, veteran-only incubators and veteran-leaning investment groups. TechStars led the way with its Rising Stars Patriot Bootcamp two years ago and now there’s now a new player pushing the boundaries – the National Defense University Foundation (NDUF).
NDUF recently partnered with the Angel Venture Forum, a mid-atlantic investment group, and created the Veteran’s Venture Forum. NDU Foundation President, Cathleen Pearl says:

Our goal is to give military veterans an opportunity to meet directly with experienced investors and pitch their business plans. Veterans have a unique set of skills and discipline, and the NDU Foundation is pleased to provide those with the passion and desire to start a business the chance to present their plans to a large group of seasoned angel and early-stage investors.

Select mentors and experienced executives have been working with veterans to flesh out their ideas and advise them on how to get those ideas funded. Those that participate in the monthly “bootcamp” sessions, which are held at Ft. McNair, can qualify to pitch to over 80 investors at the Demo Day on October 29th. These investors represent approximately $1 billion in investable wealth and are eager to fund veteran start-ups.
It’s great to see people and investors get the point I’ve been barking about for over a year: veterans know how to lead organizations in chaotic environments and given the resources, they can work magic in a scrappy start-up environment. I hope to see some of these companies with a term sheet by the end of the Demo Day in October.
In fact, some investors aren’t waiting for the NDUF demo day. Ridescout, which is currently participating in the NDUF bootcamps, recently closed its $1.4 million in funding with a $700,00 investment from one of the NDUF mentors.
The demo day is an invite-only event and not open to the public. There are three bootcamp sessions left and if you want to pitch during demo day, you have to attend at least one of these sessions to qualify.
So register here.
If I were an investor, I’d want at least one or two veteran-run startups in my portfolio because if any investor practices what they often preach, “It’s 80% execution and 20% idea”, having some of the best run start-ups, led by our country’s veterans, may be an investment strategy that any savvy investor should be pursing.

Although I can buy the all new businesses are not startups easier thansmall business owners are not entrepreneurs this sounds like Typical Silicon Valley / Wall Street / Washington arrogance once again.
I am sure though if you asked these “little people” and their families I am sure they would think they were high growth.
Let’s put this in context. The average American makes $41,600. If that same American takes their savings and starts a “small business” that Paul Graham sneers at and is able to net $250,000 a year that hat individual is now classified as “rich” here in this country. I think that’s a bit over a 6X return… compounded. Usually because these folks stick with it for a long while.

If you can’t easily explain why you exist, none of the subsequent steps matter.  A good format is “We help X do Y by doing Z”. If you really have trouble explaining what you do, give a friend/stranger/whatever a longer explanation and ask them to summarize that back to you.

Write a minimum of 300 words about the idea or how it came about:
 
 

Rewrite the idea down in less than two sentences:


Continue to step 1.


Find a name you like.


Use LeanDomainSearch.com to brainstorm/validate the name. Domai.nr works too if you are looking for a specific name.


Create a list of ten names you REALLY like!


Cross reference the name with Google search to see if you have any mega competition. Look at the number of results (under 15 million is ideal) and the quality of the top results.


example of Mega competition: spicy pop


example of Little competition: spicy unicorn



Cross reference the name with Google Keyword tools to see if people search an exact match (this can also be used for domain name idea generation)


See if your domain is used in social media with the Name Checklist tool.




Create a Gmail account. Use the name you decided on.


Signup for Unbounce.com


You do not have to put in billing info.


Read this from Unbounce or this from Kissmetrics… I am not sure which is better.


If you are really a reader, and you don’t want to learn by doing (shame on you), you can read this awesome guide.



Create a page that takes peoples email




Get a domain (www.retailmenot.com/view/godaddy.com)


Link it (DO NOT FORWARD, LINK).



Signup for MailChimp and link it also.


I am willing to do steps 1-5 for $300.


You can do it yourself in a couple hours.


It’s a bad sign if you are not willing to learn/do it and want to pay me to do it… but whatever 



Do 7 – 10 concurrently


Go back to Unbounce and make three ‘variants’. Try different wording. More, less, funny, serious, etc.


Get 500 local emails to sign up.


Aim for 1 month (max).


Start with the subcategory of Reddit and Quora that relate to your idea.


Use your network to find target customers – ask your contacts, “Do you know someone with problem X? If so, can you forward this message on to them?” and provide a 2-3 sentence description



Create a Wufoo form and embed it into a new page.


The form should be unique to your idea.


Ask a question, design a profile page… anything. Find a way to get people engaged. (asking for help here is okay… I need to explain better)


Maybe put a “pre-order” form in place (collecting billing information) even before you’re ready to collect money or have a full product.



Get a Wistia account.


Watch their video on “explainer videos” and “lighting”.

Q&A: ‘Startup Rising’ author Christopher Schroeder on the tech-business revolution in the Middle East,billmcneely,2013-10-28 13:46:12.014000,2,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'fredwilson']","Christopher M. Schroeder is an Internet venture investor and the Washington-based author of “Startup Rising,” a new book about a largely unrecognized revolution that has been quietly changing the landscape of the Middle East: tech start-ups. He spent three years making frequent trips to the region, getting to know the men and women behind this entrepreneurial upheaval.
Schroeder, former publisher of The Post’s WPNI, spoke with Style editor Frances Stead Sellers about his new book (“Startup Rising: The Entrepreneurial Revolution Remaking the Middle East” was published this month by Palgrave Macmillan), his thoughts about emerging tech businesses and the role of technology in the modern Middle East.
TWP: We’ve read a lot about the impact of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, on the Arab Spring. Can you talk a little about how that political and social uprising affected the emerging tech businesses?
CHRISTOPHER SCHROEDER: It really is all part of the same thing.  A new generation in the Middle East — as now virtually everywhere — has access to technology barely dreamed of a decade ago. They see the way the rest of the world works, they have most of the world’s knowledge at their fingertips essentially for free, they can connect and collaborate and share in unprecedented ways. We saw in the Arab uprisings people en masse demanding a political and social voice; these entrepreneurs are taking their economic futures into their own hands as well.
TWP: You’re an optimist, with an abiding faith in the power of technology and connectivity to bring about positive change. Does that come from personal experience?
CS: I have seen in the online news business, and [from] building a health and wellness enterprise online called healthcentral.com — that when people feel informed, they are not alone, they can collaborate, that actions they take can work because others have done the same [and] amazing things happen. [The term] “empowerment” is thrown around a lot, but for me, this is what access to technology is all about.  And this is [the] early days. Most experts I know believe there will be 5 billion smartphones on the planet within a decade — two-thirds of humanity with a supercomputer on their person.  Problem solving and innovation — again, bottom-up — will change.
TWP: Your book is full of surprises — [such as] times when the modern, tech-savvy young people of the Middle East defied preconceptions about the region. If you can pick just one example of a person or incident that made you rethink the region and its trajectory, who or what would it be?
CS: There are so many, but the winners of last year’s INJAZ Al-Arab high-school start-up competition really hit me like a 2-by-4. INJAZ, based on Junior League, is a region-wide program teaching basic skills in entrepreneurship to teens — over 1 million kids have done it — and they hold this region-wide competition. The winners had created solar-powered charging stations so that kerosene lamps in tent communities near their homes could be replaced by battery-based lanterns — fire being one of the greatest hazards in that community.  When I asked them where [they got] the solar panels –  expecting [to hear] some NGO had donated them — they smiled and said: “Oh, we built them! We went on YouTube and Google and found hundreds of places to learn how to build solar panels with the materials at hand. It took us 10 months!”
These were five young women from a high school in Yemen.
TWP: One of the most poignant comments in your book is from an entrepreneur in Tahrir Square during the protests that led to the downfall of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. “I have always been proud to be Egyptian,” he texted you, “but this is the first time I love my country.” What do you say now to those young idealistic entrepreneurs, in light of the recent violence in Cairo? Was their [and your] optimism that enduring change could happen misplaced?
CS: What is happening today is deeply sad and troubling. The chief technology officer of one of my favorite start-ups was shot and killed this week. It is terrible.
At the same time, what I have seen has been going on for years, and these amazing entrepreneurs continue to build and scale. As I noted, there will only [be] more, not less, access to technology coming. Two narratives are at play, and political, [social] and business leaders are making choices right now between the 20th and 21st century. These entrepreneurs have voted and are on the right side of history.
I recalled recently that when I was in business school, the conventional wisdom was: First, Japan had won; second, India was a disaster, embroiled in terrible riots at the time; and third, post-Tiananmen China was lost for a generation. In less than a decade, no one was saying any of this.
TWP: You were very much part of the Washington Post family, having served as publisher of WPNI, the former Post/Newsweek Web operation, and you still have many friends in the newsroom. What kind of changes do you envision in the American media business, particularly now that The Post has been bought by tech entrepreneur Jeff Bezos?
CS: I thought Don [Graham] and Katharine [Weymouth] made an extremely brave and selfless decision, realizing the worlds I’ve just described are happening faster and faster — so they sold this amazing company to one of the best in understanding and building to these new realities.
With so much information being spread, with so much data being put out there, with so many sharing their experiences, with increasing speed of complexity in our times, great journalism, analysis and deep reporting will matter more … [and] can be done by leveraging the best of technology and essential things only humans can do.  And, to everything I said above, billions of more people will be clamoring for reliable information and insight.
If one focuses on how to build a great news operation today — as if all this technology came first, rather than tied to, or merely modernizing, old models — I believe there is a special new future for The Washington Post around the globe.

The Fundraising Rollercoaster,mikecollett,2013-10-28 15:57:19.160000,4,0,"[u'mikecollett', u'fredwilson', u'aweissman', u'BTrautschold']","My wife and I just got back from frolicking around LA with our four young kids for a week with, of course, stops in Disneyland and Knots Berry Farm. Interspersed between rides and bathroom stops, I was on the phone helping a handful of companies that we have funded in the Promus Ventures community raise additional capital (no medals for me, it’s my job). Some thoughts on theme parks and fundraising:
Have a plan – At the beginning of each day, my wife and I unfolded our park maps and plotted how we were going to best tackle a park with four kids of various heights (and thus able to ride only certain rides). The best founders start with a strategic list of who they want to partner with, and don’t just take any call. Different investors bring unique skills, and uncorrelate your group of investors. (Full disclosure: unlike good founders, my wife and I did no prep prior to getting to each park. Hilarity ensuded).
 That plan includes being tired – Very few startups would say that fundraising was quick and painless. Fundraising is a continual process that takes on different faces at various stages of a company’s life. Good founders are continually building relationships, whether for capital and/or advisory functions. It is long and ardous. (Eating Mickey Mouse ice cream Dove bars during the late afternoon helped – maybe a suggestion).
 Expect the unexpected – Rides close when you wait 30+ minutes and are just ready to board. Trams don’t pick up on time. The lines on the height boards can vary (trust me). Investors will be all in until they’re not. Hours will be spent talking to good firms who at the end say one partner isn’t comfortable and they can’t move forward. Get used to wild reasons as to why investors are not moving forward.
 Raise more cash than needed – Disneyland isn’t cheap. But after a day (or three) there, one understands why. It is a well-oiled machine with thousands of workers making sure everyone goes home happy. Technology has made it easier than ever to start a company, but building one for the long term takes significant capital. Founders shouldn’t get too cute on valuation or terms. Get it done.
 You will question why – There will be many moments that you ask yourself, “What am I getting myself into?” (Sitting at the start of a coaster that is about to go from 0 to 82 mph in 2.7 seconds was one for me). Founders are responsible for team members and their families who have both sacrificed much for the startup. The pump has been primed, forecasts call for certain amounts of cash, and when it doesn’t come in on schedule, things can get dicey. Pack the Tums.
 Don’t let the façade of glittering castles and smiling people on the brochure fool you into Fantasyland. Every startup needs capital to grow, and since cash = oxygen, make sure you have plenty to survive. Like any good amusement ride, there are many ups and downs, unexpected bends and turns, but the thrill is like nothing else. And why we keep coming back for more."

Profits are an opinion. Cash is a fact. 
Amazon is generating a ton of cash ($4b in annual operating cash flow). 
If the cash flow keeps growing and net income stays 0… at some point one has to conclude the net income accounting is not really economically accurate or relevant. 
As Warren Buffett said, all else being equal, it’s far preferable to purchase $2 of earnings that is not reportable (and taxable) than $2 that are. 
If writing software, bringing fulfillment centers online brings down earnings, it’s because the accounting is misleading.
It’s not that it’s some kind of charity for consumers, it’s that the earnings are underreported. 
Or, to quote Warren Buffett again, accounting is the language of business, but it is an aid to management thinking, not a substitute for it."

Logistics Options for Kickstarter Projects,billmcneely,2013-10-28 20:52:17.628000,3,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'fredwilson', u'ippisl']","In 2012, Wharton professor , Ethan Mollick published a study that stated that 75% of all Kickstarter projects in the Design category were delivered late.
In a response post, Kickstarter Co-Founder Yancy Strickler asked Is Lateness Failure?
Yes, because by the time you are launching a crowdfunding project you are required to have a working prototype. A working prototype mitigates most of the delays of the creative process identified by Yancey in his piece.
As you complete your working prototype, developed a project plan working from FINISH to START in order to identify critical tasks that can’t be delayed. Use SaaS Project Management tools to plan and coordinate activities. I recommend 37Signal’s BaseCamp but any of these other 9 programs might work for you.
One critical path task that often gets overlooked on crowdfunding projects is logistics.
A lot of folks say to themselves: “I will save money by doing it myself, how hard can it be? ” or “ I will get friends and family to help me pick, pack and ship 1,000 orders ( with several permutations possible depending on rewards offered) with no idea what materials to purchase to make it happen and the least expensive ways to ship orders while pleasing the backer.
Crowdfunding Projects Logistics Basics

Measure the length, width and height of your item.
Weigh your product with packaging to get an accurate shipping cost estimate and avoid costly fees.
Buy UPC Barcodes for your product. You will need them if you plan to sell on Amazon, retailers or ever expand and use a fulfillment center. It’s better to bake this system in early then have to deal with returns with no identifying information. If you plan on using crowdfunding to launch into something bigger spend the $250 to join GS1 US. If you are cash strapped and only plan to have 1 or 2 products then go through a UPC reseller like BuyABarCode. Here is a great WSJ article on the topic.
Have an idea what percentage of your product is destined for US and international ( and where). Different destinations have differing customs requirements and costs. Nobody likes surprises.

When planning for the logistics critical path task there are 5 ways you can accomplish the task. They are:
Do It Yourself Fulfillment: This is a good option for folks who have between 100 - 150 backers,a simple reward schedule and a product that fits standardized shipping sizes. Use the United States Postal Service.Priority and flat rate boxes can be delivered to your house. For a little bit more you can offer tracking numbers and email delivery confirmation. Stay away from sexy but expensive overnight and next day delivery services like UPS and FedEx.
Business to Consumer Task Provider: These providers includeTaskRabbit, Zaarly,and Thumbtack. Again, if you had a fairly straight forward project but just did not have the time this would be a good option. When requesting bids, ask yourself how many people do I need, are the people expected to bid with all the materials mentioned above included, how much time does it take to put one of these shipments together, how far do they have to travel ( a different answer in NYC than Dallas) what skill sets do you expect and how quickly do I want this completed?
Crowdsourced Logistics Providers: This is a new segment and Mark Suster wrote a great piece about why it will be exploding in the near future. Service providers include Deliv and Shyp. The services use an app to be beckon a driver recruited along the lines Uber. You get charged a fee for them to come out and full retail postage. You don’t worry about boxes, packaging, labels etc. Your getting a turnkey logistics solution but your paying for it.
Crowdfunding Fulfillment Specialists. These fulfillment specialists include IndieShip. Using crowdfunded fulfillment specialists allows you to get a knowledgeable logistician providing a low cost, automated experience. You provide the fulfillment center with CSV file of your orders and then they pick, pack and ship your items to your backers. They generally charge you $3-5 processing fee per order, plus 10% over USPS shipping rates to destination. They also seamlessly handle international shipping to any country you may have backers in. Once you are over 150 backers you should start looking into this.
Full Service Fulfillment Service Providers Once you near the 1,000 order mark you need to look into this option. At this point you have had successful crowdfunded project that probably morphed into an eCommerce business. You need to start storing inventory for longer periods of time and shipments can’t be delayed. You also are starting to have enough volume to take advantage of discount shipping rates and you will need to preposition stock through out the United States to do so. Providers in this space include Shipwire, Amazon Fulfillment,andWhiplash .
In closing, the prevailing attitude out there is if you crowdfunded a project you have months, to worry about getting your backers their items. I challenge you to make your backers to love you speedy delivery as much as they love your creation."

In particular, chat apps, the hypothetical heir to Facebook for teens’ affections, are seeing shocking valuations. Apps like WhatsApp (US), WeChat (China), Line (Japan) and KakaoTalk (Korea) are crossing national borders to try and capture as many millions of users as possible, regardless of geography. The prize is now not merely “becoming the next Facebook,” but potentially “becoming the thing that replaces Facebook.”

Is Aereo legal but doomed?,billmcneely,2013-10-31 07:44:47.461000,2,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'nickgrossman']","This afternoon the folks from Aereo invited me and several other early adopters to lunch at the Ritz for their Dallas launch. The company has found a perfectly legal way of retransmitting over-the-air television via the internet to subscribers. The company is facing legal challenges by content providers, but they have successfully fought back each one time after time. The bad news? Content providers don’t make money when Aereo sells subscriptions to consumers.
My business partner at HAUL, Robert Bennett, met with Chasey Carey the COO at FOX who indicated that they will end over the air broadcasts if they can’t protect their over the air broadcast rights. Over the past decade content creators’ business models have changed whereby their revenues have transitioned from advertising to broadcasting rights. Content creators don’t make any money from OTA and make all of their money from OTT. What does this mean? If companies like Aereo make it easier for consumer to fire Time Warner, Comcast and Direct TV – over the air transmission will end. Ouch.
The good news is the Aereo has built an amazing product – basically a cloud based DVR for TV consumers. Basically TIVO without the box. To exist longterm they will simply need to enter into licensing agreement for content. The bad news? The service will cost more – likely driving down the cost of cable and satellite TV. In the meantime? Enjoy low cost content. I’m considering firing Time Warner. Maybe as soon as this month. I’ll let you know."
Check Out TechStars Patriot Boot Camp '13  Tameesah Desangles in Nibletz,billmcneely,2013-10-31 08:12:12.110000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"It seems that everywhere I go, people are talking about women in tech and women in startups. Everyone has an opinion on why it’s hard for women in tech (or IF it’s hard).  Some think the solution comes from changing institutions to accommodate families. Others think women just need to embrace careers and quit being timid.
There are plenty of opinions, but we in the startup world know that execution matters more than theory. Yesterday in Memphis, execution was on display.
The people behind Start Co in Memphis, TN are actually doing something to advance women in tech, and the fruit of that labor was seen in the 5 teams that presented at Upstart’s Demo Day. I talked about Upstart in July, and like most Demo Days, it’s amazing to see how far the companies have come in a few short months.  Of course, it’s still early days for all the companies, and everyone knows the real work begins after Demo Day.
WeddingWorthy.com–WeddingWorthy.com was a late addition to Upstart cohort, but when leaders saw how serious founder Tameesah Desangles was about her business, they felt she’d earned a place at Demo Day. Desangles’ company is a visual shopping platform for brides and their bridesmaids. There are thousands of things to buy for a wedding, and with 25 retailers on board, there are plenty of options.
Artwardly–Leni Stoeva changed her business model quite a bit during the accelerator, but the final product is an art-leasing platform that connects high-end art and individuals and businesses. No more Fortune 500 companies with Aunt Ida’s black and whites in the lobby. With her connections in the art world, and some great developers building the platform, Stoeva is on pace to change the way collectors, businesses, and even museums source their art.
GemPhones–We’ve written about GemPhones before, and founder Kelli Meade is still going strong. GemPhones is electronic jewelry, combining the function of earphones with the style of necklaces. Lots of people flaunted their GemPhones at the after parties, and it’s really impressive how many styles are already available.
Stylecrook–A native of Bermuda, founder Zakkiyah Daniels came all the way from Thailand to participate in the Upstars accelerator. Stylecrook is a social shopping site that allows you to receive discounts when you enlist your friends to help you pick out clothes. Let’s face it, that’s how most women shop best anyway. Stylecrook is now making it digital.
Kids360Now–Audrey Jones started her presentation with a sobering story about children harmed at a day care and taken to a hospital, but because their parents contact information was inaccessible, the parents didn’t find out until pick up time. Kids360Now solves that problem by putting the information into the parents’ hands, and allowing them to grant access when needed. A daycare administrator can simply open an app on her phone in the even of emergency, rather than trying to reach a file cabinet.
The women of the first Upstart cohort made big strides in the 3 months of accelerator life. We at Nibletz are cheering them on as they continue to grow and develop their companies.

Policy makers, however, need to understand the importance of protocols for enabling distributed permission-less innovation -- that is, innovation by many individuals and startups. For instance, the hypertext transport protocol (http) is what lets a browser talk to a web server -- as long as the server implements the protocol it can deliver innovative content or services to any browser. HTTP itself builds on many other lower level protocols, such as DNS and TCP/IP. Historically, protocols have emerged from either research projects or from individuals / small groups simply throwing something out that sticks. In the debate about bitcoin it is critical to understand that bitcoin has the potential to be such a protocol that enables a lot of new innovation to take place.
At the heart of bitcoin is a fundamental innovation: a distributed public ledger. A ledger in accounting is a book that you cannot edit once you have written in it. Instead, if you have made a mistake, the only way to fix it is to add another transaction to the ledger that undoes the error. As we know from accounting fraud, problems arise when people figure out ways to transact without recording it in the ledger or making ex post changes to the ledger (this is why Quickbooks isn't really an accounting system). The bitcoin ledger is the so-called blockchain which uses the fact that there are many copies of it that are broadly distributed combined with a fair bit of math to ensure that once a transaction has been recorded in the blockchain that transaction can not be changed after the fact. There is no other widely used protocol in the world today that accomplishes this: with bitcoin anyone can make a statement (a transaction) and have this be recorded in a globally visible and fixed ledger.
Why is this a big deal? Because as it turns out the transactions that can be recorded in the bitcoin ledger have a lot of expressive power built into them in the form of a scripting language. This allows for certain types of contracts to be built on top of bitcoin, such as deposits, escrows, all the way to distributed stock trading. For instance, there is a proposal for something called ""colored coins"" which allows additional data to be attached to a bitcoin that can then stay connected through all subsequent transactions. That data could represent, for example, shares in a company at which point the block chain becomes a fully distributed and public ledger of stock ownership (potentially replacing either physical certificates as still used by most startups or separate custody services). Because of the scripting language, the ledger is actually intelligent and once shares are represented that way it becomes possible to construct automated versions of derivatives contracts. 
These are just some examples of the innovations in financial services that bitcoin as a protocol can enable. Beyond that there is the potential to use the bitcoin protocol to solve other problems in a globally distributed fashion, such as how to assign and manage unique names (see also the Namecoin project). As various agencies consider regulations for bitcoin it will be important to balance the protection of consumers and enforcement against (organized) crime with maintaining the potential of the bitcoin protocol to be a fundamental enabler of innovation."
Future Internet aims to sever links with servers,kidmercury,2013-10-31 16:32:04.357000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"The Pursuit Internet would, according to its creators, enable a more socially-minded and intelligent system, in which users would be able to obtain information without needing direct access to the servers where content is initially stored.
Instead, individual computers would be able to copy and republish content on receipt, providing other users with the option to access data, or fragments of data, from a wide range of locations rather than the source itself. Essentially, the model would enable all online content to be shared in a manner emulating the ""peer-to-peer"" approach taken by some file-sharing sites, but on an unprecedented, internet-wide scale.
That would potentially make the internet faster, more efficient, and more capable of withstanding rapidly escalating levels of global user demand. It would also make information delivery almost immune to server crashes, and significantly enhance the ability of users to control access to their private information online.

Non-technical founder? Learn to hack,billmcneely,2013-10-31 17:59:50.029000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"I frequently get asked by non-technical solo founders if I know any potential hacker cofounders they should talk to.  These people give a passionate pitch for the idea and a long list of all the hustling they've done, customers they've spoken to, models they've built, provisional patents they've filed, etc.  Most of the time, they are thoughtful and hardworking.  But they've often been searching for their technical cofounder for many months, and things have stalled during that process. 
When people like this say ""I'll do whatever it takes to make this business successful"" (which they almost always say), I say something like ""Why not learn to hack?  Although it takes many, many years to become a great hacker, you can learn to be good enough to build your site or app in a few months.  And even if you're not going to build the next version, if you're going to run a software company, it seems like a good idea to know a little bit about it.""
Usually the response is something like ""That wouldn't be the best use of my time"", ""I don't like it"", or ""I don't have that kind of brain"".  (Earlier today it was ""You don't understand, I'm the idea guy.  If I'm hacking, who will be talking to investors?"", which is what prompted this post.)  But every once in awhile people think about it and decide to learn to hack, and it usually works out.
They’re often surprised how easy it is.  Many hackers love to help people who are just starting.  There are tutorials for pretty much everything and great libraries and frameworks.
As an important aside, if you try to learn on your own, it can be really hard.  You’ll hit some weird ruby error and give up.  It’s important to have someone—a friend, a teacher at a coding bootcamp, etc.—that get you through these frustrating blocks.
When hackers have to for their startups, they are willing to learn business stuff.  Business people should do the same.  If you're not willing to do this, you should remember that there are far greater challenges coming in the course of a startup than learning how to code.  You should also remember that you can probably learn to code in less time than it will take to find the right cofounder.
Speaking of cofounders, a word of warning: meeting a stranger for the express purpose of cofounders hardly ever works.  You want someone you've known for awhile and already worked with.  This is another good reason for learning to hack yourself instead of bringing on a cofounder.
You can build the first version of your product, and even if it's terrible (we had a non-technical founder in YC that learned to hack with Codecademy and was still able to learn enough to build a prototype), you'll actually be able to get real user feedback, iterate on something other than mockups, and perhaps impress a great hacker enough to join you.  Although you may never win a Turing Award, if you're smart and determined, you can certainly get good enough to build a meaningful version 1.
If you're a solo founder and you can't hack, learn."

Payments by Apple is Coming,kunaalarya,2013-11-01 20:23:24.472000,5,1,"[u'kunaalarya', u'azima861', u'kidmercury', u'careersity', u'johnbuttrick']","It has been speculated again and again, over the past couple of years, if you look at what Apple has done over the past year, you can see that Apple is positioning itself to be a dominant player in the space. From iBeacon to Touch ID, the foundation of a next-generation payment system is being put into place that would blow Square, Pay with Amazon, and Venmo out of the water.Why is Apple positioned to do this?

Credit Cards. Apple has 500 million iTunes accounts with credit cards attached (vs. Amazon’s 200 million). Again, 500,000,000 iTunes accounts with credit cards. With the iCloud Keychain being added next week, it will have the ability to use even more accounts.
iBeacon. Apple just rolled out iBeacon, a feature allowing anyone to set up a “beacon” using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and create location-based services. Steve Cheney talks about it best, but it can set-up hyper-location information about products, and accept payments from people.
iPad/iPhone. The iPad owns the tablet market and is an awesome shopping format. Just check out the Gilt.com app. The annoying part is putting in your payment info and addresses. As the tablet market continues to grow and become a primary device among the public, tablet e-commerce will be huge. iPhone has an even bigger place in e-commerce. You use it much more than your tablet and the market is much bigger. You carry it everywhere, allowing for easy on-location purchases.
Touch ID. If you’ve used the fingerprint scanner in the iPhone 5s, it’s kind of magical. Unlocking your phone isn’t the standout feature to me. As someone who downloads 3+ apps per day, using it for iTunes purchases is huge. It gives you a glimpse into how this can work for purchases. It doesn’t have the market share yet, but it will have the majority of iPhone users by the end of iPhone 6's cycle.
Passbook. Passbook was the beginning of getting brands into the e-commerce ecosystem by enabling Passbook-capable gift cards, show tickets, airplane tickets, coupons, etc. It may not have taken off as well as hoped, but it works incredibly well behind the scenes. And early reports of iBeacon combined with Passbook are promising.

How would it work?
As you’d imagine. Right now the checkout process is really painstaking. You have to enter all of your address details (anyone have separate billing and shipping addresses?). Then you have to get your credit card out and enter all its numbers.
I see it as the example above. Tap the Check Out button, and it gives you a similar payment system that flows like the current fingerprint App purchase. You can pre-choose your credit card and default shipping address and just scan your fingerprint to purchase. It can fill this using a Payment API across all apps. You’ll be able to buy a t-shirt from your favorite artist’s app or a new wardrobe from Banana Republic’s app.
Using iBeacon and its Core Location API, a checkout clerk knows if you’re within three-feet of a Bluetooth enabled terminal (i.e. an iPad), and you just have to say your name, and you’ll get a popup on your iPhone screen asking you to place your fingerprint for authorization. Your receipt is e-mailed to you and you’re off with your goods. You can get in a cab, and pay via an iBeacon in seconds.
Why would companies use this?
If you can get people engaged in your app and allow them to purchase items in seconds, it can improve conversion rates dramatically. There’s a lot less friction within the payment system and a higher likelihood of impulse buying. You’re not going to lose users because they have to wait to purchase an item when they’re at their computer. And you’re not going to lose users because they don’t have time to take out their credit card and type in numbers and addresses. We’ve ALL done this. You can send a push notification letting a user know of a sale, they can add their items and check out in seconds.
“Can you play your game and have a meaningful experience in the time it takes for a barista to make your macchiato?”
— Torstein Reil, CEO of NaturalMotion
In the gaming world, there’s something called The Starbucks Test,where you want to design your game so it can be played in short-bursts while waiting in line for your coffee. This is hard to do with e-commerce apps because of the way the checkout process is right now. Make the checkout process last for only a few seconds and you can easily optimize the experience to pass The Starbucks Test.
Even though Apple will charge a premium on transaction fees, it will be worth it for brands to embrace this, as it will undoubtedly increase online transactions.
It’s not all about the revenue for Apple.
The revenue potential may not be as big as some people may think. The current e-commerce market in the US is ~$270 billion and is expected to grow to $370 billion by 2017. If Apple takes 10% of the market ($37B), and charges 5% per transaction, they’ll rake in $1.85B in revenue in 2017. As a comparison, the App Store is estimated to bring in $1 billion this year, and their total revenues for 2012, were over $150 billion. Local commerce can, maybe, double or triple that revenue number if it really picks up.

It would be about building a better experience for brands and for users.
Brands would put their focus on iOS development and creating better apps for users.
Stores will incorporate Bluetooth technology in stores to enable payment via smartphones (in a way that NFC hasn’t).
Users will stick with and be attracted to iOS devices, as the overall experience is better with ease of purchasing — especially when local shopping comes into the picture.

Apple is in position to make a huge impact with all of the technology they’ve implemented over the last couple of years. If you look at it from this perspective, you can see how strategic they have been as they inevitably move towards Payments. Even the rumored 13"" iPad makes perfect sense from a retail point of view — there’s no way it would be targeted to consumers. Everything’s coming together to align for a payment system that works fast and is easy to use.

What is General Solicitation and why does it matter to you,roryeakin,2013-11-02 22:46:02.350000,2,1,"[u'roryeakin', u'aweissman']","On September 23, 2013, over one year after President Obama signed the JOBS Act into law to make securities regulations friendlier to small businesses, the ban on General Solicitation is officially gone. General Solicitation is the act of marketing a capital raise publicly (basically advertising) and had been banned since 1933 because the SEC feared hucksters would con people into investing in time machines and Nigerian oil scams. While the ban has prevented the insidious use of advertising to scam funds, it has also handcuffed legitimate companies and ideas from leveraging the efficiency of today’s communication networks to raise capital, such as the 2009 effort by a pair of LA lawyers to raise money to buy venerable beer brand PBR.
So what will change with the removal of the ban? Well, for one, if you are raising $1 million for your small furniture business, you can now advertise this offering on Facebook, in an email to your customers, on your blog, etc. The ban’s removal doesn’t change who can invest in private securities offerings though—this is still limited to accredit investors only. However, there are still a myriad of challenges for companies seeking to actually use General Solicitation and Union Square Ventures founder Fred Wilson does a great job outlining them in his blog (disclosure: USV is an investor in CircleUp). These problems include onerous filing requirements for small, often under resourced companies seeking to raise money and harsh punishments for those that run afoul of the letter of the law.
Problems aside, General Solicitation has the potential to make a profound impact on some  companies and investors. Below is some advice on how entrepreneurs and investors can navigate the opportunities and challenges of General Solicitation.
For Entrepreneurs

Not All Companies Will Benefit From Advertising. The most common misconception about the ban’s removal is that all companies will benefit from being able to publicly advertise their fundraising efforts. However, communicating with the masses is only useful if the masses understand your business. If you are raising money for an innovative popcorn company that makes tangible products anyone can try and form an opinion about, then communicating with the masses makes sense. However, if you are a biotech company developing new stem cell technology or a cloud computing company, chances are a tiny fraction of the population will understand your business, and thus advertising to the masses will likely be an inefficient use of time and resources.
Only Accredited Investors Can Invest. Even though you can now advertise to everyone, only accredited investors (individuals making more than $200,000 or whose net worth excluding primary residence exceeds $1 million) can invest in your offering, and the onus is on you (or the broker dealer you work with) to take steps to verify that they’re accredited.
Work With Intermediaries You Trust. There are a host of complexities and red tape around the use of General Solicitation, so it is critical that entrepreneurs consult lawyers, broker dealers and other advisors who know the rules cold; otherwise, running afoul of them can lead to severe penalties, including a one year ban on raising capital under Rule 506, which exempts private companies from having to register their offerings.

 
For Investors
“Invest in What You Know”. This principle of the great investor Peter Lynch applies to investors considering putting their hard earned cash in private companies. If you aren’t an engineer, or have deep backgrounds understanding the key drivers in a tech company, don’t invest in a company claiming to have a better search algorithm than Google. There are platforms that are today selling secondary stock in large private tech companies like Dropbox or Pinterest.  Lets think about that for a second- you cant see financials, you cant dig into their technology in a meaningful way and you have no access to the management team.  How would anyone in that situation know if the company is worth $2B, $20B or $200B.  If you don’t know why valuation is critical, you shouldn’t be investing into private companies.  With small consumer and retail companies, investors (i.e. those on CircleUp) can understand the product, often look at historical financials and talk with the management.  Peter Lynch’s mantra is one reason why I think consumer and re tail companies will benefit the most from this regulatory change and the resulting advertising.

Be Cautious. Investments in private companies are risky. Very risky.  While they can produce staggering returns when successful, these investments are very illiquid and have incredible volatility—you need to be prepared for your investment to be worth nothing. If you are going to invest in private companies, you should decide upfront how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to such investments and then spread this amount over at least 5-7 companies, as diversification is critical when dealing with such volatile return profiles.
Work With Intermediaries You Trust. This advice is the same as it is for entrepreneurs. For investors who plan to turn to crowdfunding portals to find deal flow, it is critical to identify the most reputable ones, as these will have the highest quality investors and, in turn, the best companies. Make sure the platform is a registered broker dealer, or partnered with one.  At CircleUp, the equity crowdfunding site where I am CEO, we pride ourselves on having some of the best consumer investors in the world and only accept a small percentage of companies that apply to the platform.

This change marks an incredibly exciting leap forward for small businesses and investors alike. General solicitation, when used right, will offer a new level of transparency and democratization to finance by giving investors more choices and allowing entrepreneurs to raise capital more efficiently so they can get back to their day job of building their business. However, all participants need to be careful on how they use/rely on advertising efforts. There will be hiccups along the way, but I believe the ban’s removal will be a win-win for investors and entrepreneurs."

Do Tech Startups and Hero Belong In the Same Sentence?,billmcneely,2013-11-03 16:00:31.732000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"One of the sites I check in with each day is Charlie O’Donnell ‘ This is Going to Be BIG blog. He generally posts something insightful twice a week and his writing does not seemed forced. I highly recommend it.
However I took exception to his October 12, 2012 What’s Your Hero Story? The premise of the post that the tech startup industry could have heroes in it much like sports . (He related how he thought RA Dickey ofthe New York Mets was the closest thing to a sports hero)
My problem with the post is the same as I have every time I tune into the general media and hear another “Hero story” generally about a little kid saving a puppy or a person doing a minor good deed. The term is over used and needs to be used more sparingly.
For better or worse, I view life through the prism of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, where I met many of my generation’s heroes. And no, not everyone that served in Iraq and Afghanistan is a hero. Only a numbered few went above and beyond what was expected of them.
One such individual I served with was my son’s name sake LT Ben Colgan. I met Ben back in early 2002 while we were both going through Army Officer Candidate School. I had just been rolled back 3 months in training after a suffering from mono and wanted to quit and just finish my time in the Army and get on with life. Instead of trying to have an Oprah moment with me and talk me out of it, he simply challenged me by saying “Can I have you stuff when you leave?” I guess that woke me up. I was 25 years old, I was getting serious with a girl who would become my wife and I need to get serious about a career, a path in life. I got to know Ben over the next few months as we were on a competition team and then parted company after graduation. Like a lot friendships in the military they soon dissipate after you move along to the next duty station and the next time I heard about been was in this Time Magazine article after return from a mission http://www.time.com/time/magazine/art…
I think after you have read his story and I think you will gain some understanding why Tech Startup and Hero do not belong in the same sentence.
I guess I came across a little harsh with Charlie, maybe because the nine year anniversary of Ben’s death is coming up here November 1st. This was his response:
I appreciate your service Bill, but no one has the right to tell someone else who their heroes should be or what they define a hero to be. My 94 year old grandmother who still drives and is as sharp as a tack is my hero as well.
Our servicemen and women have experienced unique lives and we owe our freedom to them, that’s for sure… but everyone has their own trials and tribulations that are important to them—and to what good does it serve tostart comparing. If my niece struggles with her college transition, should I tell her that it’s nothing compared to what people coming back from Afghanistan are going through? How will that help her at all? Shouldn't I take her seriously?
If you’re looking for jobs in growing companies, you simply cannot approach entrepreneurs with the attitude “What you’re going through is nothing compared to what I’m going through.” No one has any interest in working with someone like that, despite their courage and hard work.
I've personally learned that respect comes when you respect others. For me, respect for my decision not to drink came only after I realized I needed to stop making judgement about other people’s choices. I can still think I’m making the better and tougher choice, but that doesn't matter when I’m relating to others.
So, with all due respect, know that you are a hero, but don’t ever look down on someone else’s choice to call someone else a hero for what may seem like the safe daily tasks of running a business. To disprove that someone else is a hero is not a game that gets you anything for winning
After a day of reflection I thought one or two of his points had validity and this was my response:
Charlie I liked your point about family members being Heroes. At home and at church I have often heard that if you have look past the end of the kitchen dining room table for your hero you have problems. To clarify my earlier point I really believe we as a society toss the phrase Hero around too easily.When I saw your headline (after reading the post) it really did not set well with me, it rang kinda of hollow. Similar to a basketball clanging off the rim during a basketball game. In the military, the standard is set pretty high for what the term Hero means and we guard this title like a Honey Badger. In fact everyday for 14 weeks while I was at Army Officer Candidate School we passed under an arch with the school motto “Standards, No Compromise” Being open to other viewpoints is good (8 years living in the Middle East and Afghanistan will open you way up) but there comes a time when if you stand for nothing you fall anything. I really enjoy reading and learning from your blog and you know way more about startups , VC, and finance then I will probably ever know I just respectfully disagree with you on this post.
My question to you the reader is, What do you consider key components/standards of a hero?"

Pay-Per-Installs Are Going To Get Crazy,kunaalarya,2013-11-04 19:46:41.015000,3,0,"[u'kunaalarya', u'careersity', u'inTristang']","If you’re in the games industry, you’re pretty used to seeing pretty crazy CPI rates. $1-2 for strong revenue generating games across networks. This goes up to $3-5 for games like Clash of Clans and Tiny Zoo in other well monetizing games — usually done through direct deals. Then there’s the crazy $8-9 by companies like GREE and Mobage to gain steam in the Western markets.




Supercell is rumored to be spending upwards of $1M per day in installs for their two titles, Hay Day and Clash of Clans. They along with the Japanese MMORPG juggernauts continue to dominate the impressions space. King dominated as well, but they’ve moved towards a volume play now with cheap banner ads now that the game is on practically every phone.




As ARPU continues to go up in games, the CPIs will increase as well. NaturalMotion was in the news just over a year ago for CSR Racing making $10M a month. Just a few months later, Supercell was making $80M a month across two titles. This trend will continue as gamers become more comfortable spending more money on IAP and as developers optimize their revenue further through game mechanics.








You can see the trend moving up. Keep in mind this is the average cost across all apps — this post is focusing on the games/apps that make more money and therefore spend more to get quality users. Source: Fiksu
So where does it get crazy?
When King, Supercell and others don’t have 2 games in the store, but 10, 20 and more and they continue to spend the same amounts, there is going to be serious lack of inventory in the games space. Developers will have to turn to WhatsApp, We Chat, Facebook and Twitter to get volume. If that doesn’t happen, smaller developers without big budgets will be pushed out. King has over 140 games in its flash portfolio that it can move to mobile and they have 2 games in the Top 4 of Apple’s Top Grossing Chart. Supercell is working on over 40 games right now (although their strategy kills most of them before they launch) and should be releasing 5 or so over the next 18 months. Supercell also has 2 of the top 4 alongside King.




Beyond Games
Games isn’t all of it. Brands’ apps typically go for $2-3 CPIs. But if you look at apps now, they aren’t entirely useful. You can get info on new products, store locations. You can shop in them, but it’s a pain in the ass with the credit card and address entering process. But it’s pretty clear that Apple will release a payment solution for apps. The simplicity of the fingerprint on the 5s makes this something that’s definitely possible. Soon, it will incorporate iCloud Keychain which is the first step to gathering more credit cards than iTunes has right now. Pay with iCloud is around the corner. Once this happens, shopping on apps becomes a very real thing. Put your items in a shopping cart, click a Buy button, scan your fingerprint and it sends the items to your default shipping address.








This will takes brands’ apps from a brand/light shopping play, to a serious shopping platform. The value brands can get out of it can be up to $10-20 per user. Which will bring brands to spend much higher CPIs than they are now.




So What Now?
Luckily, we have a lot of untapped inventory in Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. As ARPUs increase, developers will spend more to get quality users. FB/Twitter etc., can help with targeted rewards. Although, Facebook is only skimming the surface now, they’re seeing a ton of value. Twitter hasn’t touched it, but there’s no way they’ll ignore it and let Facebook dominate. This will be very useful for brands looking to get app installs as these services can help with volume.




On the games side, to get quality users, you have to advertise in quality games, and that’s what’s going to be very limiting and will continue to drive up costs. Unless FB/Twitter, etc., find a way to target quality gamers who will spend money, it’s going to be a bumpy road.




Overall, CPIs are going to jump up and developers/brands are going to have to be creative in how they obtain users. This is just the start.

Mobile is Not Disruptive,kidmercury,2013-11-08 01:03:24.786000,2,0,"[u'kidmercury', u'nickgrossman']","Mobile is Not Disruptive  at least not yet, though i concede it will play a role in a larger disruption that is forming.   but let's look at why it's not disruptive yet:  1. same incumbents. the top dogs of mobile? google, apple, and maybe facebook. (i am only considering companies that are profitable and produce free cash flow). in other words, same top dogs as the web, with the exception of apple. apple's presence here is worth noting, and will be elaborated on shortly.    2. inability to commoditize incumbents. the hallmark of a great disruption is when the new entrant is powered by a business model that renders the resources, processes, and values of the incumbent worthless. for instance, when google introduced its cloud-based apps, they were a part of google's advertising-based business model, and thus could be given away for free. microsoft's values rewarded sales teams that could sell software, and its entire process system was designed to do just that. thus, when faced with google's new model, it was rendered immobile -- a victim of its own success. this is the blueprint for disruption.   we see none of that in the mobile world. incumbents are transferring over with ease. this is most clearly seen when we examine facebook's mobile advertising revenue, which has soared. but there are other examples: groupon has been able to migrate with ease. amazon is still the ecommerce champ. google still rules mobile search.   i find it especially interesting that even in instances when mobile offers a different technology that could be construed as an enabling technology in the context of disruptive theory, it still is not showing signs of manifesting an actual disruption. for instance, will mobile messaging systems really disrupt facebook or google? perhaps we just need more time, though the revenue is absent. likewise, the mobile app tinder, a dating app that leverages real-time connections based on location, was borne out of the incubator run by the company that owns match. maybe the folks that own match have read the innovator's solution and know how this game is played. or maybe mobile isn't as disruptive as it seems.   though ultimately i think mobile will play a role in something that fits more into the framework of disruptive theory. it is clear that companies must now, to some extent, be everywhere: accessible by desktop, laptop, phone, tablet, and increasingly, video game consoles, televisions, watches, glasses, and who knows what else. moreover, users are expecting a harmonious experience when interacting on a variety of devices. perhaps the enabling technology is integration, which apple has always championed, and thus perhaps this is part of why apple has been able to return to a position of market dominance. perhaps integration will open up new business models, such as selling hardware, selling bundles of apps and hardware, or different pricing structures based on device. perhaps. at the rate things are going, we'll find out soon enough.

Bitcoin the Technology vs Bitcoin the Money,kidmercury,2013-11-08 18:21:55.500000,6,23,"[u'kidmercury', u'fredwilson', u'JasonGelman', u'LonnyLot', u'polemitis', u'AustinLAC']","Bitcoin the Technology vs Bitcoin the Money

In this blog post i'll refer to bitcoin the technology as BTC-T, and bitcoin the money as BTC-M. 

BTC-T includes stuff like the blockchain, how the currency is issued, the protocol, and that type of stuff. 

BTC-M refers to the US dollar, the money, the exchange rate, the price chart, inflation, monetary policy, etc. 

BTC-M will not work, because price will never stabilize. a rising price is not good, nor is a falling price good. only a stable price that moves slowly is acceptable. History suggests that asset prices are never stable without intermediation by a third party, usually something resembling government.

BTC-T is a technology that seems to be gaining adoption. However, it is an open source type of thing; ie more like Linux then like iOS or Windows. Open source is good for cost reduction, but ultimately something closed/governed is needed to provide businesses with the opportunity to innovate and create the customer experience that is desired. ie Amazon used open source android to lower its development cost, but forked it and closed it to create the profit opportunity and user experience that was needed.

In terms of the closed cybercurrency that will succeed,I think the model employed by gaming companies is the correct one (yencoin is one example, as well as amazon coin). However, these closed systems may be built atop a variation of BTC-T. More likely in my opinion, though, is that BTC-T will be the basis for an inter-platform standard that facilitates currency exchange across ecosystems. This might be comparable to how a federation of closed operating systems is forming around android.

Profit opportunities need to be examined closely here. Open source is often anti-thetical to profits if not used properly, and often results in huge governance issues stemming from resentment towards for-profit participants.

Ultimately, though, BTC-T will have great difficulty succeeding (meaning crossing the chasm to achieve mainstream usage) in my opinion, unless BTC-M -- or some derivation of it -- can succeed. And for BTC-M to succeed, a central bank, a closed platform, and a government that rd us beyond the nation state model of governance are needed.

Access to Startup Opportunity for the Veteran via Joseph Kosper of RideScout,billmcneely,2013-11-09 05:09:13.686000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"The  Veteran transition should not be this hard.
Many of today’s veterans, with a knack to thrive in austere conditions, a worldly perspective, and experience in fostering local market places overseas, want more than a job in the civilian sector—they want to create something for themselves, their family and their country.
As was the case with our past generations of veterans, a public-private partnership is more than necessary—it is essential. Today’s veterans need a basic education in the business of business, along with introductions to the network of wealth and capital that provide us the resources we need toget started.
Congress can help stimulate a new economic period of growth, much like the era fueled by the GI Bill, to give these vets the access to the education, training and resources they need to start a business. The cumbersome process of the Veteran-owned business concept must be revised and streamlined. In short, the government would serve its veterans best by providing access to capital and then give them the freedom to succeed. If you do this, I promise you will not be disappointed with what they accomplish.
I’d like to take a few minutes to discuss some problematic trends I have witnessed firsthand, and recommend some ways Congress can facilitate solutions.
First—- Despite the best efforts of the VA and DOD, transition to civilian life from active duty still presents steep “cliff” in the life of a servicemember. Unfortunately, it gets worse with the number of years a person serves in uniform on active duty. Too many of my peers fail to realize the importance of staying connected and keeping ties with their civilian counterparts during multiple decades of service.
So the first and most important thing we can give our Veterans is the freedom to succeed. Because despite all the virtue I describe in my written statement, there are several things we discourage in the military or down-right outlaw that should be reexamined. If we want our Veterans to succeed as civilians we must set the conditions that prepare them while they are Soldiers. Not with a 2 week ACAP program 6 months before their retirement date, but with a holistic approach to developing the Soldier and the individual.
If we are going to start a company or at least avoid a typical cubicle—we have to understand the language of business. We do a great job of getting our service members to study the culture of an area before we deploy into a theater, yet we don’t do a very good job of training them for the culture of business. They enter the civilian sector not versed in the language, dress and norms of a world fueled by private business. We can do better.
It should not be as hard for the next generation of Veteran entrepreneurs as it was for me. For example, I would spend my evenings and weekends working to build RideScout while I was still teaching leadership and strategy at the University of Texas at Austin Army ROTC. I would often find myself doing a superman routine—changing in a bathroom stall after work—moving from uniform to civilian clothes to attend an event after work.
Unfortunately, our military still frowns upon military transition activities in the final years of service. It’s an important issue, because the longer a person serves, the more time that person needs to prepare for a transition.
I have longtime Army friend with over 20 years of active service who just recently signed up for his first LinkedIn account. Ten years after it was invented, he never saw the value in starting up an account and reaching out. Another friend spent the final 90 days of his service frantically looking for a position that would pay him at least as much as he earned in his final year of service.
It does not need to be this hard… We can balance the need to avoid conflicts of interest between military and civilian activities with the critical task of smoothing the slope of the Veteran cliff entry into the business world.
Without asking permission, I audited a class at UT-Austin on entrepreneurship. I started to learn the vocabulary of the private sector. Training is one thing, but hands on is quite another. Our ethos as officers and Soldiers currently frowns upon this kind of “dual life” But there is real value in better preparing for the transition.
The mandatory classes I attended for my retirement were often long rooms with people of all ranks and backgrounds clumped into one room. Worse, it was clear that the level of instruction was designed for the lowest common denominator.
Veterans need freedom to succeed—and that starts with setting the conditions for success over the breadth of service in uniform.  Today I would propose that the Services explore a policy to allow separating Servicemembers one week of permissive TDY for each year of honorable service to pursue the venues that will enable them to set the conditions for a successful transition.
The second major obstacle to our new Veterans’ is their limited access to capital. Often, what most of us need is just a little seed funding to explore an idea. In my case, my seed capital came from my co-founder who saw the potential in the idea of RideScout. After that, a significant portion of our investment money came from veterans who saw something in the potential in our idea and in our team.
Angels and Investment groups are often concerned about the lack of entrepreneurial experience in a Vet startup. I am convinced, if I was a 19 year old whiz kid with a command of three programming languages, RideScout would have received double digit funding over a year ago.  The first investment is critical for the veteran to prove he can succeed—and yet investors often want proof of this success before they are willing to invest.
And so today I would also propose Congress explore a program to match the funds a Veteran can raise in starting a new business—up to $1,000 per honorable year of service. For me, after a 20 year career, such program would have made a huge difference. Sadly, there is a Veteran owned company out there that you’ve never heard of nor will you ever. For this company, such a program would have made all the difference.
Today’s Veterans are independent, driven and idealistic. They think big, they dream big and they genuinely believe they will succeed even when they face the starkest of odds. As we like to say when we have a particularly tough day in RideScout: It can’t be that bad, nobody is shooting at us.
For the last 5, 10 and in some case 20 years, we served our country in support of defending the American dream of free enterprise. Today marks our turn to participate in that dream. And whether you are a for-profit business, a consumer of American goods and services, or a member of Congress, the Veteran is a wise repository in which to invest your time and your money.
People matter.

Want someone to stand with you and speak up at City Council on your behalf? Find a veteran.
Want to find a partner to start a business? Find a veteran.
Making it happen…it’s what we do.
I am proud to testify today in front of a legislative body that not only understands the challenge we face but also embraces the opportunity to be a partner with and invest in one of our nation’s most important enterprises—the U.S. Military Veteran.

Medicaid: It Kinda Works Like the Greek Banking System,billmcneely,2013-11-10 16:27:37.829000,1,2,[u'billmcneely'],"Since I returned from Iraq in December of 2011, 21 months ago, ago my family has been without health insurance. Up until our savings ran out in May of 2012 we just paid out of pocket for doctor’s visits and medicine. In May, when our savings ran out, we just stopped going.
When my son, Colgan, went back to school in August 2012, the school let us know he was having trouble concentrating and behaving in class. We let the school know we could not afford to send him to the doctor let alone to get the prescription filled. The school was kind enough to send us forms to get him enrolled in Medicaid. My wife filled out the forms and within a few weeks Colgan was enrolled. That was the easy part. My wife did a search for doctors that accepted Medicaid here in the Saginaw, TX area and found 10. When my wife called each them they all said they were not accepting any new patients.
Fortunately for us, Suzy had a childhood friend who was now a pediatrician in Dallas which is an hour’s drive away. Ritalin is a controlled substance so if we did not fill the prescription fast enough, a wrong annotation was made or I forget the original prescription (you have to do produce the old one to get the new one) I had to make the trip all over again.
The other fun part of this experience is the actual trip to the pharmacy.
I guess they don’t like dealing with Medicaid either. Back in January of of this year, one morning we gave our son his last pill. If he skips a day or 2 no problem, but by day 3 it’s an issue.
2 weeks passed before I could manage to get the prescription filled. We were told the medicine was too expensive, the wrong code was used, our doctor had not cleared it with Medicaid etc. I am missing a few excuses but each one represents a separate trip to the pharmacy. During this whole time the Pharmacy Techs claimed they were working issue calling and faxing on our behalf. When our doctor’s nurse asked for the call history on the case, turns out the pharmacy never called Medicaid regarding our son’s case nor had they sent the faxes to our doctor like they claimed.
Unfortunately, after this incident we ended up transferring to a doctor closer to our house. The new doctor at first allowed our son to keep taking the same medicine as before. Then in March, she questioned why Colgan was taking such an expensive medication. So she switched him to a less expensive but not as effective brand. The next month she said he needed to be tested all together and since he was on Medicaid he had to wait 6 months and in the mean time she was not writing any more prescriptions.
Colgan’s performance in the classroom both in academics and behavior suffered through April and May. The summer months were hard for him as well.
When he went back to school 2 weeks ago the teacher sent a note home that something had to be done. So we found a doctor on our own and paid $175 for the visit, half my paycheck for the week. Same protocol , same tests same questions but no drama.

Infowars subsequently obtained documents from a government insider that revealed how the mesh network was far more than just a means of tracking people’s locations, it was also linked with DHS fusion centers and collected a “wealth of information” from the cellphones of people in the coverage area.
The Seattle Police Department responded to the controversy by announcing that it will temporarily deactivate the network, which was rushed through the Seattle City Council with virtually no oversight, and allow public scrutiny of the system before proceeding.
“The wireless mesh network will be deactivated until city council approves a draft policy and until there’s an opportunity for vigorous public debate,” SPD spokesperson Sgt. Sean Whitcomb said last night, adding that turning off the system involves, “a little more than just flipping a switch.”"

For a limited time during their launch, the company will offer solely Coinsetter’s books with a growing amount of professional liquidity from market making arrangements.
Coinsetter expects to offer Bitstamp’s order book alongside its internal book, which over the coming weeks will provide customers with access to both exchanges through a single platform. According to Lukasiewicz, the two exchanges have a strong relationship, with Bitstamp having built additional features to enable Coinsetter to more effectively offer reliable quotes and accounting. Coinsetter plans to add at least one more exchange to their consolidated book in the first half of 2014, as well as additional bank deposit methods, margin trading, enhanced order routing, futures, short positions and interest-bearing accounts in the longer-term.
The exchange will feature a maker-taker model, where high-volume liquidity providers are rebated 0.10% for adding limit orders to Coinsetter’s book, while orders that pull liquidity off the books pay fees starting at 0.50% and declining to 0.20% with higher volume. For a limited time at launch and through the remainder of November, the company has announced that all trading on Coinsetter will be free of charge."

We have also made substantial progress with machine learning. A great example of this is recent progress towards self-driving cars. It was only 2004 that the DARPA Grand Challenge ended with not a single vehicle finishing the closed course. Less than 10 years later Google’s self-driving cars have completed over a hundred thousand miles on public roads.

Our Government Has Weaponized the Internet. Here's How They Did It | Wired Opinion | Wired.com,kidmercury,2013-11-16 19:14:51.294000,1,1,[u'kidmercury'],"Here’s how it works.
The QUANTUM codename is deliciously apt for a technique known as “packet injection,” which spoofs or forges packets to intercept them. The NSA’s wiretaps don’t even need to be silent; they just need to send a message that arrives at the target first. It works by examining requests and injecting a forged reply that appears to come from the real recipient so the victim acts on it.
In this case, packet injection is used for “man-on-the-side” attacks — which are more failure-tolerant than man-in-the-middle attacks because they allow one to observe and add (but not also subtract, as the man-in-the-middle attacks do). That’s why these are particularly popular in censorship systems. It can’t keep up? That’s okay. Better to miss a few than to not work at all."

Retailers Embracing Mobile Will Have a Happy Holiday ,billmcneely,2013-11-16 23:59:04.455000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"Retailers who embrace mobile correctly for Christmas will flourish. Those who don’t ,won’t.
I’ve come to realize this while I work as a cashier at Target.
This week I had a guest (customer) come through my line with $400 worth of Christmas toys. The guest told me if we would match the best price the Red Laser App was finding she would buy with with us. I thought, no problem Target gives the cashier a lot of latitude to make the guest happy, so I agreed.
I did not think it would be that much but the guest was saving $20-$30 an item. 3 other guests overheard this and immediately downloaded the app.
Later on, I figured out these 4 guests bought about $1,300 of the day’s $115,000 sales. That works out to 1% of our sales for that day. That’s would have been a lot to let walk out the door.
The next day I related this story to the store manager. He said what scares him more are the customers we don’t know are using the apps and leave the store without giving Target the opportunity to compete for the business.
One way to counter this is to own the free Wi-Fi network in store by using a service like Mike Perrone’s SocialSign.In . Through the use of a Facebook or Twitter sign in you get will allow you to gain insight into what price comparison apps they are using, what products they are commonly searching for and what competitors app/sites they are referencing to make buying decisions is extremely useful.
If you don’t feel comfortable revealing your margins to cashiers you can always setup a negotiating interface that works directly with your Point of Sales suggests Timothy Meade .
You can also tie into a shopping app like Target’s Cartwheel app (they use Facebook sign in) to offer savings on products they would be interested in. In Target’s case it’s important because their app is the 3rd most downloaded shopping app on iOS according to Union Square Ventures . The app usually offers more savings (20% +) than say their Red Card (5%) without the debt ( credit card version ) or having another card linked to your checking account ( debit card version)
One last suggestion to retailers. Open up your inventory to the guests. Let your guests see what store location has the style, size and color in stock they desire. Trust me they will drive to get it and end up buying more stuff. Worst case scenario, partner with Wharfie, Deliv, Shyp orTaskRabbit to have the item delivered the same day.
Retailers can follow approved price matching policy or try to cherry pick competition, but you will lose."

Bitcoin Emergence Prompts FinCEN to Issue Guidance on Virtual Currencies,Alacra,2013-11-18 14:54:55.226000,2,2,"[u'Alacra', u'kidmercury']","As Bitcoin gains recognition as a legitimate currency in the world of digital transactions, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) has issued guidance on the regulations that apply to administrators and exchangers of virtual currencies that will test AML and KYC programs.
Swings in the market value of Bitcoins – tied to limited circulation – continue to fuel speculation on whether Bitcoin is a fad or fixture for e-commerce. The value of a Bitcoin was about $20 at the beginning of this year before spiking to $240 in April, dropping to $75 in July and then climbing to nearly $400 at the beginning of November and $500 this past weekend. (http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv)  While the debate on the future of Bitcoin continues, it is instructive to understand its stealth origins.
Mysterious Birth of Bitcoin
The tale of Bitcoin’s circuitous emergence could have jumped from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel.  Building on earlier ideas for bit gold and b-money the proposal for a peer-to-peer e-cash system was floated in a 2008 paper by “Satoshi Nakamoto” – commonly believed to be a pseudonym for a group of programmers (but with some suggesting that the NSA was behind the façade!).
The enigmatic Nakamoto further refined the protocol for using an encrypted digital coin in a 2009 blog post which stressed the need for the system to be decentralized to eliminate the risk of a central bank devaluing the currency through imprudent lending practices or insufficient protections against identity theft.
Nakamoto mined the first 50 Bitcoins, known as the genesis block, in 2009.  Then, at some point in late 2010, Nakamoto vanished and no longer contributed to the Bitcoin forum, as reported by Wired Magazine in a 2011 article entitled “The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin”.  The Bitcoin community continued the launch and currently maintains a public ledger called the “block chain” that tracks every transaction.
Digital Coin Territory Attracts New Breed of Investors and Miners 
The growth of the Bitcoin market attracted an eclectic group of investors including Olympian rowers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  The Winklevoss twins represented the U.S. in pairs rowing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but they are probably best known for receiving a $65 million settlement after claiming Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social-networking site while they were all attending Harvard.
The Winklevii, as they are known, began buying Bitcoins early in the game and their coin purse is now worth over $40 million, or about one percent of the over $4 billion worth of Bitcoins currently in circulation, according to a recent Washington Post article.  In May 2013, the twins invested $1 million in BitInstant, a Bitcoin payment processor.
Other companies leaping into the Bitcoin mining and processing market have included BitPay (with investments by PayPal founders), Ripple (with investments from Google Ventures), Coinbase and CoinLab.
Miners are issued a certain number of Bitcoins based on their ability to use programs to solve and validate mathematical puzzles.  To control circulation, the Bitcoin algorithm automatically adjusts the difficulty of the math problems based on how fast they are being solved to maintain a fixed rate for the creation of new Bitcoins.  Issuance of new Bitcoins will stop once circulation hits 21 million coins.  When the 21 million cap is reached and mining ceases – projected to occur around 2140 – processors will have to rely on transaction fees to generate profit.
While operating without a controlling government, bank or clearinghouse continues to set Bitcoin apart from other types of electronic fund transfers, the open-source environment creates a space that is ripe for government control through regulations.
FinCEN Issues Guidance on Virtual Currencies
FinCEN issued interpretive guidance earlier this year to clarify how Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and FinCEN regulations apply to users, administrators and exchangers of virtual currencies.  Under the regulatory framework, virtual currency is defined as having some but not all of the attributes of “real currency” and therefore, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.  Specifically, the FinCEN guidance addresses convertible virtual currency which either has a real currency equivalent value or serves as a substitute for real currency.
The roles of persons (including legal entities) involved in virtual currency transactions are defined by FinCEN as follows:

User:  A person who obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services
Exchanger:  A person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds or other virtual currency
Administrator:  A person engaged as a business in issuing into circulation a virtual currency and who has the authority to redeem and withdraw from circulation such virtual currency

A person, or legal entity, may act in more than one of these capacities.  Further, it is important to note that “obtaining” virtual currency covers much more than the scenario of a “user” who merely purchases virtual currency.  Depending on the model of the particular currency, a party could “obtain” virtual currency through various acts including earning, harvesting, mining, creating, auto-generating, manufacturing or purchasing.
The threshold issue is whether actions will subject a person or legal entity to BSA’s registration, reporting and recordkeeping regulations that apply to money services businesses (MSBs).  A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not subject to MSB compliance because such activity does not meet the definition of “money transmission services” and the user would not be a “money transmitter.”
However, an administrator or exchanger engages in money transmission services and, as a result, is a “money transmitter” under FinCEN definitions by (1) accepting and transmitting convertible virtual currency or (2) buying or selling convertible virtual currency.  As a money transmitter, the administrator or exchanger would generally be subject to MSB reporting and recordkeeping.
Further, the FinCEN guidance expressly addresses the category of de-centralized virtual currency – the Bitcoin model – and states that “a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.”
In the area of foreign exchange, accepting real currency in exchange for virtual currency is not subject to FinCEN regulations applicable to “dealers in foreign exchange” since a forex transaction involves exchanging the currency of two countries and virtual currency does not constitute legal tender as a currency of a country.
MSB Compliance Requirements
If a person, or legal entity, is deemed a money transmitter by operation of the FinCEN regulations and guidance relating to virtual currency, then MSB registration and ongoing compliance is triggered pursuant to the BSA.  Reporting and recordkeeping requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:

Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR):  A SAR must be filed within 30 days of becoming aware of a transaction that is suspicious and involves $2,000 or more.  A transaction is suspicious if the MSB has reason to suspect that it involves funds derived from illegal activity, it is designed to evade BSA requirements or it serves no business or apparent lawful purpose.


Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program:  An effective AML program must be developed, implemented and maintained that is reasonably designed to prevent the MSB from being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing of terrorist activities.  The program must be commensurate with the risks posed by the nature and volume of the services provided.  Key requirements include developing internal controls, verifying customer identification and integrating compliance procedures with any automated data processing systems maintained by the MSB.


Currency Transaction Report:  Financial institutions must report every transaction in currency involving more than $10,000.  The institution must verify the identity of the individual presenting the transaction and record data including the individual’s name, account number, Social Security number or taxpayer identification number.

MSBs are also required to conduct independent reviews of their AML programs, on a periodic basis, to meet the BSA “independent audit function” provision.  In guidance issued in 2006, FinCEN explained that while MSBs are not required to retain an outside CPA or consultant to conduct the review, “it may be conducted by an officer, employee or group of employees, so long as the reviewer is not the designated compliance officer and does not report directly to the compliance officer.”
Before entering the Bitcoin market, financial institutions need to recognize that as “money transmitters,” they will be subjected to the stringent compliance requirements that MSBs have to meet.  Financial institutions interested in serving as an administrator or exchanger of a virtual currency should carefully evaluate whether their AML program is integrated with existing automated data processing systems and whether their KYC protocol can sufficiently identify customers to support SAR and AML functions.
Virtual Fund Frontier is Not Immune to Rough Terrain
As some pioneers and miners successfully blaze trails across this new frontier, others find themselves plodding through rough terrain.
Faced with a challenging re-launch of their website, Winklevii-supported BitInstant’s website has been down for several months and the company is promising a 25% reduction in fees to loyal customers.  Meanwhile, the Winklevii have created the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust for the purpose of starting an ETF that will track digital currency performance.
Earlier this month, Alydian Inc., a portfolio company of CoinLab, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing nearly $4 million in debt.  CoinLab, a Bitcoin business incubator, launched Alydian in August to provide large-scale mining systems to non-technical customers.
Law enforcement officials are concerned that sophisticated criminals may be using virtual currency for illegal sales of drugs, guns and malicious software.  In October, federal agents seized control of $28 million worth of Bitcoins from an online drug market known as Silk Road.
On the marital bliss side, newlyweds Austin and Beccy Craig from Provo, Utah have vowed to use Bitcoin as their only currency during the first 90 days of their marriage as they travel across the U.S. and to Stockholm, Berlin and Singapore.  As they relay stories of organizing “bitmobs” on their blog, they are soliciting donations – Bitcoins accepted! – to fund a documentary about their e-wallet adventures.
If your financial institution serves as an administrator or exchanger of Bitcoins, will your AML and KYC programs meet BSA compliance requirements?

"Bitcoin-powered assassination market targets Obama, Bernanke, and others | The Verge",kidmercury,2013-11-18 16:08:29.293000,1,1,[u'kidmercury'],"Bitcoin has long been accused of aiding money-laundering, but today it's been implicated in a more grisly business: assassination. In Forbes, Andy Greenberg details a site called Assassination Market, which offers up crowdfunded bounties for the murder of public figures. As previously reported in The Daily Dot, the site is primarily motivated by hostility to overreaching government, offering bounties ranging from 40 bitcoin for President Obama to a whopping 124 bitcoin for outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. At current bitcoin rates, that would add up to over $70,000.
The site takes advantage of a feature that lets users encode information in a Bitcoin transaction. By predicting the date of the assassination in advance and encoding that information in a one-dollar donation, a user could verify she was responsible and thus claim the money. As Greenberg points out, it's similar to the assassination market modelposited by cypherpunks in the '90s, but the new site has put the idea into practice using modern anonymizing tools and is currently collecting real money, potentially attracting the attention of federal law enforcement."
Chinese can now buy real estate with Bitcoin,kidmercury,2013-11-18 16:15:13.801000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"Bitcoin acceptance in China has now extended into real estate with a residential developer in Zhangjiang Hi-Tech park in Shanghai finding a new way to promote sales through the acceptance of Bitcoin virtual currency.
Shanda Group, one of the large IT giants in China, through its real estate development arm, opened sales of its first real estate investment project on October 25th, 2013. 300 apartments in the soon to be built buildings ranging from 42-81sqm were available for sale and sold out in a few minutes as demand far outstripped supply.
As part of the promotion, Shanda accepted Bitcoins for payment. Although the exchange rate was ‘fixed’ at 1,000 Chinese Yuan (CNY) to one Bitcoin and the developer reserved the right to adjust the rate, the deal represents one of the first times that Bitcoin could be used for such a large scale 'public' purchase. The exchange rate was about 1,200 CNY : 1 Bitcoin on BTCChina that day, so the developer was obviously trying to hedge a bit in case Bitcoin fell through, but considering the rate is rapidly reaching nearly 2,000 CNY : 1 Bitcoin, it would have been a great deal for the developer – Bitcoin is one of the few investments in China that has been increasing faster than real estate in 2013."

Help me gather data to save energy through a more efficient inbox,ggrinch,2013-11-18 18:30:08.616000,1,0,[u'ggrinch'],"I’m looking for some real stats and technical help on determining if a Greenbox (Green Inbox) is an idea worth exploring further…
Someone mentioned to me the other day that he heard that if we all cleaned up our online inbox’s we’d save a megawatt of power.  I’d never really thought of things from this perspective and it did get me thinking about the practicality of it, whether I would do it, how it may look to users, etc…
After some technical thinking out loud on my part, we figured that it’d be interesting if Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc…had a “Make My Inbox Green” button - a “Greenbox” if you will.  It could do something like lower your storage quota to 250MB, clean out all SPAM and Junk Mail weekly, opt-out of email or redundancy, etc… 
The thought was that we all have email accounts on many services that we don’t really use. I, for example, have a hotmail/outlook.com account which I only have because of my Xbox and Windows 8 system - I don’t even check the email.  I used to work at Yahoo, so have a Yahoo Mail account but abandoned it years ago when I moved to a shell account.  I logged in recently and there was loads of garbage taking up space.
Using email accounts for storage also seems to be a little less in vogue with the advent of Dropbox, Google Drive, and the others.  I think the ‘average’ user may not understand these cloud based file systems, but us more advanced users certainly know that email is not a file system.  Getting that original 1G of space from Google was super compelling, but not so much now. 
From an infrastructure standpoint, I understand (at an abstract level) how difficult it may be to actually evacuate used spindles.  I am wondering, however, with the advent of storage virtualization, block tiering, and whatever other nifty storage tricks are out there if this is easier than it sounds.  Do some of the custom file systems in use make this easy to do; make it east to consolidate storage if there was a massive drop in usage to the point where we could reduce power usage by a significant amount?
So the question to the community is posed.  Would a Greenbox option be practical?  How much power could we really save if something like this was out there (perhaps as the default)?  How much storage being consumed is SPAM/Junk or simply over a year old?"

Why Does the Government Like Bitcoin? (Answer: Tax Collection) | Armstrong Economics,kidmercury,2013-11-19 17:49:41.512000,2,0,"[u'kidmercury', u'aweissman']","Do not get all excited that bitcoin will replace the dollar. Sorry, they are exploring the idea and allowing it to get press for one single reason – they intend to go to an electronic “virtual” currency so they get 100% of all taxes. In 1934, they printed $10,000 notes when a Cadillac was $600. Today, $100 is the biggest bill. The next phase is no bills. The euro tried to displace the dollar issuing €500 denomination notes. In Britain, they have made them illegal – it is all about taxes. The virtual dollar is coming. I would say after 2015.75 when the Fed has zero power and they will go electronic. So for now, bitcoin serves a purpose to get people use to the idea of a cashless society."

"TPP WikiLeaks: White House claims to support cellphone unlocking, but treaty negotiations say otherwise.",kidmercury,2013-11-19 22:30:02.465000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"
The leaked treaty draft shows that while the White House was championing restoring free market principles to phones, the U.S. proposed that the TPP lock in the process that allowed the Librarian of Congress to rule this technology as illegal through international law. This would make potential reforms like H.R. 1892 impossible.* It should be noted that Canada did submit an amendment proposal that could allow unlocking, but neither the United States nor any other country supported it.
But the TPP draft doesn’t stop there. It would ban numerous other technologies that have beneficial uses. In particular, the legislation would ensure that jailbreaking—which is installing a different operating system on your phone, tablet, or e-reader—is illegal. It’s already on precarious ground in the United States, but under TPP it would be illegal in all circumstances.  What type of nation would arrest 23 million people for installing a different operating system on their own device?

Since we launched the new site last month, we've split out the usv-specific theming and functionality from the core ""Conversation"" app, which we're open sourcing here.  The name comes from the original blog post launching USV.com as a blog back in 2005, in which Brad talked about ""having a dialogue with the market"" and ""publishing the conversation"".  So, ""The Conversation"" it is.  
Here's everything:

Code: https://github.com/unionsquareventures/theconversation
Public dev list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/conversation-app
Community hackpad, where we've been tracking ideas, suggestions and bugs so far: https://hackpad.com/USV.com-Launch-Plan-sHgpc56rkCZ
Detailed work tickets: https://github.com/unionsquareventures/theconversation/issues (incomplete / non prioritized atm).

The app is written in python, using the Tornado web application framework and is backed by mongodb.  (FWIW, the USV instance is hosted on Heroku, front-ended by Cloudflare, and takes advantage of a bunch of services like MongoHQ, New Relic and Sendgrid).
A lot of people helped get this app / website off the ground, and they deserve some props here:
Zach Cimafonte, USV's ""Hacker in Residence"" this past year, built the core of the app (and was the reason that I personally got to learn python + mongodb, which has been super fun)
Zander Pease at USV spent months wrangling the USV partnership around the project (not an easy task!), and coordinated all of the various moving parts.
Sumit Paul from Studio Kudos (who did the new USV logo design) did a lot of the core web design and CSS.
Andy Cochran injected an awesome dose of visual niceness when we needed it.
and Kevin Marshall (aka falicon) recently helped us profoundly clean up and simplify the app -- bringing in best practices for building tornado + mongodb apps he's been honing for a long time now.
And, of course, everyone in the USV community who has made using the app and being part of the community really fun.  We're looking fwd to continuing to improve the app, to make everyone feel included, heard, and even more a part of the conversation.
So, that's it for now.  Welcome aboard and happy hacking!"

Gaming Company Fined $1M for Turning Customers Into Secret Bitcoin Army | Wired Enterprise | Wired.com,kidmercury,2013-11-20 18:36:07.450000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"A gaming software company has been slapped with a $1 million fine after secretly adding bitcoin mining software to a product update earlier this year.
E-Sports Entertainment Association (ESEA) — which lets serious CounterStrike players face each other down in anti-cheat modes — infected about 14,000 of its customers with the code, which ended up mining about 30 bitcoins over two weeks last spring.
The company blamed a rogue employee, who has since been terminated. It’s still facing a class action over the matter in California. “What transpired the past two weeks is a case of an employee acting on his own and without authorization to access our community through our company’s resources,” ESEA co-founder Craig Levine told WIRED back in May.
The settlement was announced today by the New Jersey Attorney General, which says that ESEA will pay $325,000 of the fine upfront, and will only be hit with the rest of the penalty if it’s caught misbehaving over the next decade."

Conversely, if some legal action crushes demand, and sellers flood the market, no entity is in position to drain that extra supply and keep things stable.
The fact that demand for money fluctuates isn’t unique to Bitcoin. It happens with dollars, too.
In the fall of 2008, for example, demand for dollars grew so much that severe deflation surely would have set in had an official entity not been around with the power and will to create trillions of new dollars to satiate that demand and keep prices relatively stable.

Don’t Be a Jackass to the Email Connector,billmcneely,2013-11-21 20:43:22.389000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"Yesterday, I received an email from an individual in the defense contracting space . This particular individual was introducing a subordinate to his network in order to speed the employment process. The intro email was well written and the resume attachment worked just fine. Unfortunately, the sender dumped his address book not in the Bcc box, but into the “To” box, where everybody on God’s green earth could see everyone else’s address on the list.
The reaction that ensued was swift and angry. However the anger was not well directed. Instead of 22 receivers emailing the sender one on one requesting to be removed from his list professionally, they each decided to hit the reply all button and share their displeasure with several hundred people.
I also saw several receivers accuse the sending of spamming which was not the case as his contact information was clearly displayed and use of military jargon was exquisite . As a side note, I received an email from his co-worker on the same program making a similar request, so its apparent that their contract was coming to a close.
Lastly and more disturbingly, on more than one occasion, I saw receivers threaten to blacklist the sender and his subordinate from their company’s hiring process over a simply networking email. Really?
The economy in general is shaky and the defense sector specifically, is shrinking, let’s be human and help each other find their next gig. If you don’t want to help someone, just ignore their email. If they reach again, respond with a blow-off message. If they are persistent block their email address.
It is that easy. There is no reason to be rude, mean, or unprofessional.

Thought I try the new USV to gather thoughts on our new app, Triage.
Triage pulls everything happening at work into one mobile feed, by monitoring the SaaS services you already use. From there we can a) intelligently alert you when resolution is needed, b) help you communicate with colleagues about what's happening and c) resolve, assign and act right from the app (coming soon).
At launch we've integrated with 8 services (Stripe, Google Analytics, Github, New Relic, Sentry, etc), mostly targetting developers.
A few questions for you all:
1) High level pitch sound interesting and clear? Or no?
2) When it comes to work, how do you stay on top of what's happening when you're not at your desk? Is email succificent? 
3) We're trying to alleivate pain in a few areas: 1) awareness, 2) communication and 3) productivity or action. Do you feel pain in those area's? If not, how come?
4) Any services you'd like to see integrated?
Thanks! Charlie"

""In that race, I think the censors will lose and I think the people will be empowered."" And while Schmidt does think that blocking governement intrusions won't happen right away, he did note that Google's been hard at work doing just that since the revelations earlier this year.

The Day the Veteran Suicide Rate Became a Face ,billmcneely,2013-11-22 02:23:35.727000,2,2,"[u'billmcneely', u'kidmercury']","On Wednesday,February 29, 2012 I was packing for my trip out to San Francisco to attend the Veteran and Military Resource Fair when my wife and I received some horrible news. Former USMC Lance Corporal Zachary Olson had committed suicide inside an apartment he shared with his brother. He was just 23.
Zachary had completed 1 tour each in Iraq and Afghanistan. His tour in Afghanistan occurred during the height of the fighting to clear Helmund Province of the Taliban. Zachary had finished his Marine enlistment in August of 2011. Zachary had stuck around Hawaii with 2 other of his squad mates to wait on some paperwork ( I am guessing VA related) related to injuries that occurred during combat. All three had enrolled in a local college but were kind of drifting along, no guidance or direction on what to do, using the GI Bill to pay for living expenses. As the fall rolled on, each squad mate decided to go back home and get on with the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 young men lost their way and committed suicide within just a few months of returning home.
His mother Diana had this to say on his passing:
For our dear family and friends who live away and have not heard yet, our youngest son, Zachary, has passed from this life on earth to a much better place with his heavenly Father. We so appreciate all the love and support of our many friends who are praying for us. We anxiously await the arrival of our other son from Kuwait and covet your prayers for his safe return. Our son,Zachary, came home from war but he has become a causality of this war.
As our heroes come home it is imperative that look for signs of behavior that does not match their personality and encourage them to seek help from the VA. The 18 veterans we are losing to suicide each day is just too many.
We should also support organizations like Team Rubicon ,The Mission Continues , The Wounded Warrior Project and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) who are providing opportunities for service once vets return to the United States. In addition all these services are keeping the issue of Veteran Suicide in the public conscious by engaging Congress and the media.
If you know a veteran in crisis please stay with them and call 1-800-273-8255 and Press 1 for immediate information on how to mitigate their situation."

""as human capital becomes more knowledge than muscle based, this only enhances the value of the common stock. Knowledge-based human capital pools by definition draw more synergies than muscle-based ones because ideas have the capacity to multiply exponentially and enrich everyone by doing so. Muscle, on the other hand, is finite and absolute. The boundary to knowledge is hard to cap, especially if you engage in a crowd-based system that expands the limits of your own cerebral capacity.
Perhaps this is why the paradigm shift from a muscle to a knowledge economy looks so bubbly and singularity-like, and why the economy increasingly needs bubbles to support it?

How 10 people built a competitor to Amazon.com for $1 million—in 90 days - Quartz,kidmercury,2013-11-24 02:02:37.951000,4,1,"[u'kidmercury', u'nickgrossman', u'Avatar_Jack', u'annelibby']","New parents love Amazon for overnighting huge parcels full of diapers and other essentials. So it’s curious that something like Boxed needs to exist at all. But in Huang’s view, “Amazon doesn’t do wholesale. If you look up stuff we sell in sizes we sell, Amazon either doesn’t carry it, or they carry it through a reseller who marks it up 25-30% higher than we do. Online, there’s not many things per unit that are cheaper than what we sell right now.”+
Like most new businesses, though, the concept isn’t the one it started with. When Huang and his team started Boxed, they thought their most avid buyers would be young, technologically savvy men in cities who would buy things like protein powder and energy bars—but those items barely moved. “It turns out the use case is actually… you’re a mom who would rather spend time with her kids on the weekend than burn a whole afternoon at Costco,” says Huang. As a result, the company’s customers skew heavily female."

Take note of WHY they need you in the spreadsheet (for a later step).   3) Handwrite a short letter telling the two people at each company you think they are awesome and give them a coffee on you (drop in a $5 Starbucks card). Don't tell them who you are. [Cost $420]   4) Handwrite the two people at each company a followup letter. Do not tell them what your service is or who you are, but let them know what your benefit is -> ""Imagine if you could increase X by Y in Z time""... we should chat sometime."" Let them go around asking everyone what's going on ;)  [Cost $120]  5) Handwrite another followup, this time include a your name. Say, ""Hey <person>, we really should chat over (coffee/skype/dinner/phone). I just realized not only can we help you with X by Y in Z time, but we can also... Sincerely, Cherise W."" [Cost $120]  6) Handwrite the last followup envelope. Include a business card of your sales rep. On the back of the business card, handwrite a call to action appropriate to your needs (to close the sale). Ask that they bring anyone else that should be involved. [Cost $120]  7) Close that sale!! I'd be shocked if you don't get a meeting with 3 out 5 of these companies and close the sale with 1 out of 3 or 4 of those. Bottom line, out of list of 30, this equates to 4-6 closed deals.   Total Cost: $780 ...at the weird chance it doesn't work, all your eggs weren't in one basket ;)  PS.

A Soldier’s Journey from Delta Force to Education Entrepreneur,billmcneely,2013-11-26 02:53:25.025000,1,0,[u'billmcneely'],"At Uvize we are inspired by stories of service and education. We are particularly inspired by our friend Scott Warren’s story from being a Delta Force operator, where he was awarded the Purple Heart, to student, father, educator, and entrepreneur. We are big supporters of his venture ‘My Dad Reads to Me‘ . We believe this service will make life better for deployed parents and their children. We even backed his project on Kickstarter here. We thought Scott’s story would be better told by himself, so here it is:
HI my name is Scott Warren, I was a Special Operations Operator. For years I was on the cutting edge of  military technology and tactics. We iterated gear and techniques in extreme circumstances and our feedback was sometimes fatal. We used our field experience to identify opportunities for improvement, complete the mission and keep soldiers alive. I didnt know it at the time but I was working with a group of entrepreneurs; creatives in the field of war.
I left the military in 2006. Having only an associate’s degree, I felt like I needed a higher degree for no better reason than “that is what you do”.  I looked for an online college that would credit as much of my military training as possible. I chose Kaplan University and completed my bachelor’s degree in just under two years.  It is fair to say that I got out of the process what I put into it – very little.
In 2010, my wife’s work took us to Istanbul, Turkey. I began searching for ways to make money online. I tried to build websites and use affiliate marketing. I read a lot about marketing, website construction and SEO which helped me realize that I lacked a basic understanding of business so I looked for an online MBA program.
Thunderbird School of Global Management had an executive MBA  program based out of Geneva, Switzerland. This program was executed by a US accredited business school, classes were presented in person by English speaking professors and Geneva was about a 2 hour flight from Istanbul. I was eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill and Yellow Ribbon Program which made funding comfortable.
The MBA changed my perspective entirely. It taught me how to look at the world through the medium of business, rather than the political or ideological paradigms I was accustomed to in the military. What this curriculum lacked was the “start” part of startup.  Concurrently, I did a self-directed study in entrepreneurship.  My first reading 
was  Lean Startup which led to Steve Blank’s course “How to Build a Startup”. I watched YouTube videos and took free classes at Udacity(.com). It was an intense time for learning.
After graduating in May 2013, I started my own company, My Dad Reads to Me (MDRM).  It’s based on a pain point I identified during deployments.  This work has become my passion. I make a lot of mistakes and continue to learn by trial and error.  I read a lot and ask for a lot of advice from friends and mentors. I also lean on my education and network for support. In the next post I will elaborate on how I am using education and entrepreneurship to impact other parent and children.    -Scott Warren"

Google’s open source solver, or-tools, took two gold medals and two silver medals. The gold medals were in parallel and portfolio search, and the silver medals were in fixed and free search.

Most AVC regulars will cite Fred's ""anything goes"" policy as a reason its successful, and probably the most popular startup forum on the Internet next to Hacker News. Fred not only lets opposing opinions fly, he encourages them. And when his word is being challenged, both he and the community readily offer rebuttals — they don't cower.

The demonstration at Fort Bennington required robots to accurately shoot a heavy M240 machine gun at ranges of up to 800m.
Other weapons fired by the semi-intelligent machines included a grenade launcher and even a Javelin fire-and-forget anti-tank missile.
Hartley, of 5D robotics, assured reporters that the machines were not just killers. ""Robots can save lives,"" he said."

Bitcoin: Bitcoin under pressure | The Economist,kidmercury,2013-12-01 15:30:06.684000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"But as part of Bitcoin’s design, the reward for mining a block halves every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Sometime in 2017, at the current rate, it will drop to 12.5 Bitcoins. If the returns from mining decline, who will verify the integrity of the block chain?
To head off this problem, a market-based mechanism is in the works which will raise the current voluntary fees paid by users (around five cents per transaction) in return for verification. “Nodes in the peer-to-peer network will try to estimate the minimum fee needed to get the transaction confirmed,” says Mr Hearn.
Bitcoin’s growing popularity is having other ripple effects. Every participant in the system must keep a copy of the block chain, which now exceeds 11 gigabytes in size and continues to grow steadily. This alone deters casual use. Bitcoin’s designer proposed a method of pruning the chain to include only unspent amounts, but it has not been implemented.
As the rate of transactions increases, squeezing all financial activity into the preset size limit for each block has started to become problematic. The protocol may need to be tweaked to allow more transactions per block, among other changes. A further problem relates to the volunteer machines, or nodes, that allow Bitcoin to function. These nodes relay transactions and transmit updates to the block chain. But, says Matthew Green, a security researcher at Johns Hopkins University, the ecosystem provides no compensation for maintaining these nodes—only for mining. The rising cost of operating nodes could jeopardise Bitcoin’s ability to scale."

Also, the thread started off with a wallet of stolen funds containing $90 million worth of coins, however they've discovered other wallets that contain more than $600 million worth.
IMHO, essentially this money, by all Bitcoin processors, etc. should be considered dead. It would be best if there'd be some way to actually determine that they were stolen (e.g. proof and proof of original ownership)
This is the kind of self-policing the ecosystem will need to do, unless wanting incumbents - like banks - to start implementing Bitcoin-like services, and backed by these kinds of security systems; It might not actually be all that bad, assuming they don't keep the business model giving them billions in profits.

And although the Bloomberg leadership brought an open bull-pen culture to the Mayor's Office and operational discipline to the top-most positions in New York City, it bypassed an official effort to implement an urgently needed bottom-up citywide innovation program involving its employees.

The number of deals is up 19% in 2013, thanks to what CB Insights describes as a surge of interest in the sector.
That, in turn, has venture capital firms adding partners with an expertise in security, a highly technical and fast-moving field. In August, Allegis Capital added four partners who will focus almost exclusively on the security market. Ackerman, one of the firm's founders, said he believes the additional expertise will help Allegis keep its advantage over newcomers who are just discovering the space.
""One of the things that is endemic in the investment community is that there's a herd mentality,"" Ackerman said. ""But these problems are very complex. This is not like building an iPhone app.""
Expect the stampede to continue. CB Insights tracked 78 cybersecurity companies that over the last year had either been acquired or launched an initial public offering of stock. The IPO in September of San Jose-based FireEye, which doubled on the first day of trading, has only fed the frenzy.
""There's a lot of runway ahead for this industry,"" said Anan Sanwal, an analyst at CB Insights.
The cybersecurity boom is not without irony. Silicon Valley has done more than any other place to create the technologies that have made the world a more connected place. But that's also what has made it a more dangerous place, creating a new opportunity for the valley to fix the problems it helped spawn.

The question we grappled with is how can we preserve what is best about the Internet but recognize that there are bad actors out there that all of our portfolio companies should be aware of and protect themselves against.
Just about the time we began grappling with this question I met Michelle Zatlyn, one of the co-founders of CloudFlare. We were both serving on the FCC’s Open Internet Advisory Committee. I was the only venture capitalist on the committee and Michelle was the only entrepreneur. We found ourselves working together to defend the freedom to innovate on the Internet in a room full of telecom and cable network operators, who were more concerned about the freedom to operate in a way that minimized their costs, maximized their revenue and ensured their strategic control over their networks. I came to appreciate her values long before I fully understood her business.
Our first glimpse of the importance of CloudFlare came from Chris Poole, the founder of our portfolio company, Canvas, and before that 4Chan. He found CloudFlare at a moment of desperation. 4Chan was knocked offline by a denial of service attack and he was scrambling to find a solution. I am not sure how Chris learned about CloudFlare but I remember clearly, how big a difference it made in his life. Once he switched his DNS servers to put 4Chan behind the CloudFlare network, the DDoS attack was immediately mitigated. He also found that his site’s performance improved, but most importantly, it gave him the confidence that his site could be reliable, fast and secure, without a huge investment in his own internal site reliability team, something he could not afford.
Now CloudFlare was on our radar. We started spending more time with Michelle and her co-founder Matthew Prince. We started to learn just how interesting and important CloudFlare was. Matthew likes to explain CloudFlare by referencing the typical network implementation of a large institution like a bank or an Internet service. At scale these networks invest in equipment to improve 1) performance, 2) load balancing, 3) WAN Optimization, 4) secure the perimeter (firewalls), 5) fend off DDoS attacks and malware. This equipment defines the edge of any large network. CloudFlares contribution was to realize that all of this could be abstracted into the cloud as a service, and that by offering this set of services CloudFlare could open up the market to the millions of smaller sites who could never dream of deploying and managing this kind of infrastructure themselves. Once we understood that CloudFlare was democratizing access to these essential services in a way that preserves open emergent innovation on the Internet, we knew we should do everything we could to get Matthew and Michelle to accept an investment from us. We are thrilled today to be able to publicly announce that we led CloudFlares most recent round. We look forward to working with a great investor syndicate, a great team, and the million and a half sites already on the CloudFlare network to make these essential network services available to innovators large and small worldwide."

Instead what grabbed me was her advice about improving listening skills – largely targeted at diversity issues – and how well it applies to any project manager.

""The Blue Button, however, is where the problems with Smart Disclosure come to light. It has been suggested that the Blue Button is essentially useless because the formatting of the data is often unreadable. With this in mind, the government is revamping the system and plans to relaunch the Blue Button in 2014.
The Green Button has also been criticized, with some users being perplexed with the amount of personal data on offer and how to use it. Ted Eytan, a blogger from Washington, DC, writes that he was baffled by the number of apps on offer and found that many were unfinished and others didn't work. He was also concerned that he had to provide information that he did not want to give just to review his energy data.""

Data covering January to June of 2013 shows a total of 3,846 orders or requests from governments to remove information, covering 24,737 pieces of data worldwide. Numbers have been growing steadily since Google started publishing the report in 2010; in the last half of 2012, it received 2,289 requests to remove 24,191 blogs, videos, or other pieces of information.
Turkey's harsh online and offline crackdown on protestors in 2013 made it the most censorious country: courts and officials sent 1,673 takedowns of over 12,000 items, the largest number by far. Google says it ended up removing around 200 items from Google+, Blogger, Search, and YouTube. Russia's internet filtering law, which went into effect in late 2012, also pushed its numbers higher, with an increase of 125 percent since the last report and a total of 257 requests for 277 pieces of data; last year, it asked for only 114 takedowns. But in total requests, it didn't come close to topping the US, which sent 545 requests for 3,887 takedowns."

What we see on the surface is that Phil Robertson stuck to his beliefs about homosexuality in an interview with  GQ Magazine (formerly Gentlemen’s Quarterly).  A&E decided that they did not agree with his stance and chose to suspend Phil Robertson from the filming of the hit reality show Duck Dynasty.  But there’s more to this story than meets the eye.
A&E didn’t mind offending atheists by showing a family prayer at the end of each episode.  They certainly didn’t mind offending animal rights activists when they showed Phil Robertson and family killing wild animals.  
Why would A&E suspend Phil Robertson and not just cancel his contract or cancel the show all together?  My bet, is we are witnessing a very clever butt covering trick turned marketing ploy.  It’s likely the best I’ve seen all year!"

This got me thinking about another abused word. Founder.
Every guy or gal with an idea at StartupWeekend or a few days at a co-working space or the local Starbucks who uses Squarespace, Wordpress or Tumblr to bring a site to life, seems to use this word. Are they really a Founder of a company? Are they working to working toward finding a sustainable business model?
I have been thinking a lot about this this past year, in an attempt to keep it real. On my LinkedIn profile I use to list myself as Founder ofStartupGuruTV. Am trying to get users, paying subscribers or sponsors? No, not yet. I am just trying to keep my head above water on finding content and then scheduling broadcasting of said content. I often use project instead of company when I describe StartupGuruTV. I have a desire to turn it into a business but its not there yet.I think the proper term is Curator.
When I moved on to Wharfie this past fall, I faced the same dilemna.

You might not have the resources of a big company, but you have a tons of other things going for you. Things big companies at times wish they had.
You can make decisions on the fly. Try new things (and make mistakes without having to explain to investors). Focus on long-term fan building and not worry about quarterly profits. You can flip your business model in an afternoon, easily react to market changes, and generally operate without a bureaucracy that stifles creativity.

The Importance of an Annual Time Block and Ideal Week,JaysonFeltner,2013-12-30 15:25:14.046000,1,0,[u'JaysonFeltner'],"
This week I am creating my annual time block for 2014 and updating my ideal week. Without this exercise, the new year will be chaos.  An annual time block guarantees that the important things get scheduled.
What gets scheduled gets tracked and what gets tracked gets done.  Getting the important things down on my schedule gives the important things in life a chance to actually get done.  December is  the perfect time to update or create an annual time block and ideal week.
During this process I analyze what worked this year.  I also analyze the more important statistic of what did not work.  For instance, I failed to stay connected to my outside team.  
I follow his approach and schedule the most important non-discretionary things first.  I then move to the most discretionary things:
1. Company Holidays
2. Church Holidays
3. Industry Events
4. Vacations
5. Board Meetings
6. Meetings with Outside Team
7. Business Review Meetings
8. Special Trips
9. Time With Friends

Unfortunately, founders often have a hard time getting the attention of investors, who prefer to invest in equities or real estate. A site called Bigcolors, which launched at the beginning of December, wants to help connect angel investors and startups by offering a crowdfunding platform with a twist. If a startup meets its goal before its eight-week funding period is up, investors can then trade shares in the company even before it officially launches, which lets them enjoy more liquidity. Bigcolors recently expanded to Singapore and plans to roll out in more Asian countries before heading to other emerging markets around the world.
Bigcolors CEO James Giancotti was an early investor in Makible, the Hong Kong-based 3D printer maker, as well as Taxiwise and Perceptar. Before co-founding Bigcolors, Giancotti worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
Giancotti created Bigcolors to help solve challenges faced by the early-stage startups and their supporters in Hong Kong."

“High availability computing” has, alas, sometimes been presented as a buzzword, which gets in the way of discussing the actual issues in the many zero-failure initiatives, with terms like Non-Stop Computing, Unbreakable (fill in product genre here), and a gamut of lofty, expensive, and even impractical projects. Most such terms are the lore of marketing teams, rather than those that had to make these systems work. This article is for developers and sysadmins who really do care about keeping systems running no-matter-what, with resources that might aid in achieving that goal.

“First it’s practical. Local currencies stay and develop in the region. Second ideological.

The average public tech company value has falled by more than 2/3rds from $4.3B in the early 80s to $1.4B today, as measured in 2014 dollars.
Why is this the case? The industry has fragmented and players are pursuing smaller and smaller market opportunities, decreasing company size. The first technology companies were industry creators, monopolizing transistors and mainframes. In 1981, IBM was worth about $100B in 2012 dollars and represented 76% of global IT market cap across 28 companies. Total domination.""

In the face of sound expert analysis, AT&T and Verizon have been on a campaign to label any effort to promote wireless competition as somehow self-interestedly “rigging the market.” This type of loaded rhetoric is particularly ironic coming from these two legacy monopoly carriers which were handed their original low-frequency licenses, free of charge in the monopoly era.  No one is suggesting handouts this time around.  Our members simply want to compete on a level playing field, with a fair opportunity to participate and win.  Does anyone really believe allowing one or two carriers to purchase the entire block of 600 MHz spectrum is a good deal for the U.S. consumer?

My response:
If we call Friendster the beginning of online social networking in the current sense, then the social web has existed for about twelve years. Further, we had widespread Internet use in the US for less than decade before that rise of explicitly social software.
Thus far, teen departure has consistently been the beginning of the end for an online social network, but I think we’re in a transitional period. We have never before had a generation that grew up with online social networks (or, for that matter, the Internet itself) as a part of their lives, and I don’t think we know what role social services will play in their lives as they age.
We tend to think that younger people “get” the Internet — are the bellwhethers and trendsetters — because they grew up with it, where the olds have to learn it. But what happens when you have middle aged people who grew up with the Internet? When everyone grew up with it? "

Last week we started experimenting with a new look for the usv.com front page, with a few goals in mind:
First, we noticed that many posts were going un-noticed, largely due to the fact that very few (10%) of visitors were viewing the /new page, where new stories first land.  Not a good experience to post an article and have no one notice it, especially if it's your first one (or if it happens a few times in a row).
Second, we wanted to explore ways to establish more of a ""rhythm"" to the site, and liked the idea of using on the day as a unit of focus.
So, here is a first pass at a revised design: 
http://usv-newfrontpage.herokuapp.com
Please feel free to kick the tires on it, compare and contrast to the real front page at http://usv.com, and use it just as you would the regular usv.com (they are using the same database). And please leave any feedback in the comments here.
Thanks!
Nick
p.s. as always, if you're interested in using or contributing to the open source app behind usv.com, you can do that here."

These inputs can give your mobile apps even more useful functionality.

In 1956, Syd Shaw and I wrote ""Warm and Tender,"" which Johnny Mathis recorded. It became the ""B"" side of Johnny's first hit, ""It's Not For Me to Say."" Our ""Warm and Tender"" didn't get much radio play—but because our song was on the flip side of all the 45-rpm records that had Johnny's hit on the ""A"" side, we were paid whenever the single was sold in record stores. Today, there are few record stores. No 45s. No B sides. And far fewer people who want to own recordings in physical form. On the upside, there are millions of people experiencing music in more ways than ever before.
Online and mobile services offer great opportunities for the next generation of creators. But despite new technology, it will always be hard to write a hit and the majority of songwriters will struggle to make a living—especially because the law is not in tune with the digital revolution.
Today, many songwriters are being denied fair compensation as a result of antiquated regulations that were conceived over 70 years ago for a different world. Songwriters are especially disadvantaged because we are governed by outdated settlements between the Justice Department and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, better known as Ascap, and Broadcast Music Inc., or BMI."

This is matt mullenweg's post pondering what to do about his blogging software, back in 2003.  I'll just quote the whole thing here because it's so awesome, especially looking back 11 years from a time, now, when wordpress powers 21% of websites on the internet.

This site is beginning to grow and grow, and forward compatibility has lately been in my mind more. Several days ago this site passed twenty thousand unique visitors, and more than seventy thousand hits, since late August. I recently converted everything (except the photolog) to XHTML 1.1, which was nice, but it’s not the markup I’m worried about. Mylogging software hasn’t been updated for months, and the main developer has disappeared, and I can only hope that he’s okay.
What to do? Well, Textpattern looks like everything I could ever want, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to be licensed under something politically I could agree with. Fortunately, b2/cafelog is GPL, which means that I could use the existing codebase to create a fork, integrating all the cool stuff that Michel would be working on right now if only he was around. The work would never be lost, as if I fell of the face of the planet a year from now, whatever code I made would be free to the world, and if someone else wanted to pick it up they could. I’ve decided that this the course of action I’d like to go in, now all I need is a name. What should it do? Well, it would be nice to have the flexibility of MovableType, the parsing of TextPattern, the hackability of b2, and the ease of setup of Blogger. Someday, right?

Organic vs. Transactional Apps,bwats,2014-01-31 00:41:39.650000,10,12,"[u'bwats', u'staysmall', u'fredwilson', u'r4nji', u'jeffbodle', u'ckurdziel', u'frankmireault', u'Vintage141', u'ARealist', u'nickgrossman']","I found myself on this article ""Mobile-First Is Old News. Think Platform-First,"" and I can't stop thinking about this one part.

There are two main ways to engage with apps:


Organic - By tapping on the app icon.


Transactional - Through a push notification or email to perform a certain action (e.g. reading a message).


For some reason, I've never thought about apps this way — as being organic or transactional.
Here's a hackpad where I've started to categorize popular mobile apps: Hackpad — Organic vs. Transactional Apps
What this tells me is that transactional mobile apps that leverage a device's native features (camera, real-time, gps, accelerometer, etc.) might be where the value of mobile is really created. Apps that are organic can reach large audiences, but may have to do that elsewhere (by building a brand, solving a problem, or having a network effect).
What do you think of all that?"

           Couldnt agree more with your post about network effects & novel UI that helps startups create competitive advantage whether its Etsy or Twitter. We at Waygum.io are trying to do something similar. We are attacking the mobile app dev space. As we all know there is a lot of activity in the mobile domain with startups, enterprises cranking up apps to keep up with the demand, we are taking a novel approach to this problem. While we are not trying to replace developers, we are trying to build widgets (a self contained block of code represented in the form of a widget) that can be dragged & dropped to add rich functionality. For e.g using our cloud based IDE you could drag n drop a google map widget & twitter widget to build a mobile app that shows tweets on a google map. This can be extended to the enterprise where you can have salesforce funtionality cross bred with Box APIs to build an app that shows the combination of the 2. Again to your point about network effects we want to build a marketplace where developers can host & sell interesting combinations of different enterprise systems to other clients and build complex mobile apps using these basic widgets. Kind of like lego blocks for enterprise systems. Please check us out @ waygum.io

Satish Mandalika

Love a garmint fishing expedition:
Rubin and some other MIT classmates developed a computer code called Tidbit for the Node Knockout Hackathon in November 2013. Tidbit uses a client's computer to mine for Bitcoins as an alternative to website advertising: in exchange for removing ads from a website, a user would give some CPU cycles to mine for Bitcoins instead. Tidbit was clearly presented as a proof of concept, with the developers making clear the code was configured not to mine for Bitcoins. That's because in addition to refining the code, they needed to work out the legal details, like drafting a terms of service, and the ethical details, like making sure there was a way for users to opt-in to the service so their computers weren't being used to mine Bitcoins without their knowledge. Tidbit won the Node Knockout award for innovation and the students thought they were on their way to continuing with their project.
But in December, the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs issued a subpoena to Rubin, requesting he turn over Tidbit's past and current source code, as well as other documents and agreements with any third parties. It also issued 27 interrogatories -- formal written questions -- requesting additional documents and ordering Rubin to turn over information like the names and identities of all Bitcoin wallet addresses associated with Tidbit, a list of all websites running Tidbit's code and the name of anybody whose computer mined for Bitcoins through the use of Tidbit, although Tidbit's code was not configured to mine for Bitcoins.

The Definitive Two Step Process to Stay On Top of Everything,JaysonFeltner,2014-02-06 23:53:31.393000,1,0,[u'JaysonFeltner'],"Being successful in the workplace often means having the ability to stay on top of everything.  Most workers are completely overwhelmed by their workload.  The answer to their problems lies in their ability to quickly and efficiently process the onslaught of responsibilities coming at them.
The other night over dinner, as she usually does, my wife asked how my day had gone.  “Surprisingly well” I answered.  I then went into ,probably too much, detail about why my day had gone so well.  “I’ve found a simple two step process to help me stay on top of everything” I told her.
As an executive and leader of my company, I can sometimes feel the weight of the world on my shoulders.  I often return home at the end of the day completely spent and feel like I achieved nothing.  I have goals and objectives for my company, but some days, it seems I spend all my time attending to the urgent things that pop up.
I find it impossible to stay on top of everything we have going on!
Many leaders can sympathize with this feeling.  Day after day we find ourselves emerged in urgent tasks and requests from employees.  By the end of the week we’ve achieved none of our business goals.  Worst yet, sometimes we find that we’ve forgotten all together what our goals were!
What has my workday go “surprisingly well” is a two step process I’ve developed to help me stay on top of everything.  This is how I do it:
1. Process everything twice daily
2. Track everything in real time
Of course the beauty is in the details.  Here is how I execute this two step process to ensure I stay on top of everything going on with my company.
Process In twice daily – I have an inbox, email inbox, and voicemail.  This comprises what I call “In.” I’ve downloaded Xobni to find out when I receive most of my emails.  I’ve scheduled my processing of in to occur right afterwards.  This ensures that, even though I only check email twice a day, I am responding to people quickly.
Gather your gear – I open my email, currently Mac Mail.  Then I grab my papers from my physical inbox.  Lastly I pull my phone near.  Finally, I launch Nozbe.  This is everything I need to complete the process.  Below is my stand up desk ready to “Process In.”
Process Email – Here is a screenshot of how I clear my email inbox in less than 30 seconds.
Mail ActOn – I use this app to help me process my email inbox.  With just a few clicks of my keyboard, I can completely stay on top of everything in my inbox.  Using the hotkeys pictured below, I make 1 of 4 choices for every message.  I use only 4 so I can set my finger on the keys and very quickly make decision.  I typically clear my inbox in less than 30 seconds.
1. Trash it – these are emails I don’t absolutely need
2. @Action – these are emails I must take some form of action on personally
3. @Waiting For – these are emails that contain something I can delegate
4. Processed – these are all the emails that I want to save but don’t need to act on or delegate
Enter Nozbe – I open Nozbe and Mac Mail in such a way that they split my computer screen.  I can then open my @waiting for folder.  I add all the new items and delegate them to employees.  Anything still in there that an employee has checked off of Nozbe, I delete or send to “Processed” if the email is still important.  I do the same process with @Action, but I don’t delegate these tasks, they’re mine.
Process Paper – Now expand Nozbe to full screen to limit distractions.  Pick up the first piece of paper and make a decision on it.
1. Trash it
2. Delegate it – Enter it into Nozbe and assign to the appropriate employee
3. Take it on – Enter it into Nozbe for yourself
4. File it – These are important items but require no action
Process Voicemail – I treat my VM the exact same way as my other inboxes.  To stay on top of everything, you have to have a central location for everything.
1. Trash it
2. Delegate it
3. Take it on
4. File it – I typically write down the pertinent information and stick it in the appropriate file.
The most critical aspect of performing “Knowledge Work” is to gather everything together in one place so you can keep track of it all and stay on top of everything that is going on at your company.  This two step process has made my work much more enjoyable.
The entire process takes less than 10 minutes each time.  The peace of mind that comes with knowing you’re able to stay on top of everything is sublime.  20 minutes a day is a small price to pay to become a super productive, organized, stress-free high performer."

I believe transparency solves most problems in an imperfect democracy. I rarely read something that sets me back on my heels and forces me to re-evaluate those beliefs. Eben Moglen did just that in this series of lectures. 
He talks, here, about how NSA surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with freedom. He goes on to argue that private companies are not really engaging in a consensual trade of services for data because even if you agree to the trade when you use FB or Gmail, the other people in the picture or sending you the mail (from another service) did not. He suggests that we should all use encrypted communications links, store data locally and run our own servers, using open source software. Essentially, he says, don't trust anyone. 
I don't want to believe this is our future. I want to believe we can trust architectures or services to aggregate data, mine it, and then use the insights to improve our experience. I want to believe that we can find a way to harness collective intelligence and accelerate positive social change. 
If we end up with data balkanized in millions of personal encrypted servers, how will we ever see the forest for the trees?
The problem is that I think Eben is right that the NSA's capacity has seriously out run its judgment, and most of the big web services are way too cavalier about their user's data, so I need help in critiquing Eben's argument.
There are a lot of embedded assumptions about the ways in which public and private surveillance undermine freedom. He does not seem to consider alternatives like greater transparency as a possible cure for the very real dangers of centralizing data collection. Are there ways to acknowledge the risks Eben identifies and still believe that we can have freedom and collective intelligence?"

A new category of accommodation was created, called “Private Rental”, which allows local residents to rent the home in which they live on an occasional basis.

If the rentals generate noise or nuisance complaints from neighbors, or if there is evidence that the residence is rented out as a business, law enforcement may investigate.

What the Natural Gas Powered Future Will Look Like and Why It's Almost Here,JaysonFeltner,2014-02-19 10:24:15.275000,2,1,"[u'JaysonFeltner', u'Mac4McCarthy']","My career has been spent in the natural gas industry.  No matter what the price has been, the fundamental economics of natural gas continue to be solid.  Natural gas, more than any other fuel in the world, has all the makings of the best fuel choice for our future.
As oil production continues to decline around the world, we are forced to begin looking into alternative sources of energy.  No other readily available fuel has what it takes to maintain our economy as a whole.  Nor is any other source as abundant.  The kicker of natural gas is that it is domestic.
This is what our future natural gas fueled society will look like.
1. Security – Gone will be the days where the United States is dependent on fuel from hostile nations.  We will no longer need to protect our interests in the Middle East.  The North American continent will be mostly energy self-sufficient.
2. Transportation – 94% of our imported oil is currently burned via transportation.  In the new natural gas fueled society, all our vehicles will run on CNG (compressed natural gas) or LNG (liquefied natural gas).  The stations look and operate the same as traditional gasoline/diesel fuel stations.  These stations currently exist and are rapidly being installed along the highways of our country.  Allied Equipment is the nation’s largest manufacturer of CNG Storage Spheres for these stations.
3. Pollution Drops – With such a drastic reduction in particulate matter, our climate will have a chance to correct itself.  Global Warming will no longer be a threat.  Gone will be the smog of LA.  Air quality will improve and so will the health of the nation.
4. Costs Remain the Same – Thanks to an abundance of natural gas and the relatively low cost of production, natural gas prices shouldn’t exceed the $10 to $15 a Mcf (million cubic feet) range in the future.  This will result in gasoline gallon equivalent prices of an average of $3.00 or less at the pump across the nation.  Many natural gas fired power plants are currently supplying power to the grid at competitive rates.  Increasing the number of these plants will keep electricity prices from rising.
5. We Export – The United States currently will become a net exporter, funneling money from other nations into our own economy.  We are the “Saudi Arabia of natural gas”.  With current Asian demand at $16 a Mcf, the price should only continue to rise. Two new LNG export ships are currently on order and the Panama Canal is being expanded to accommodate these ships.  The United States could export LNG within a few years.
This natural gas fueled society in the United States is a likely scenario as oil production continues to fall, conflict continues in the Middle East, and Americans become more comfortable with hydraulic fracturing.  My personal hope is that my 2-year-old son is able to live his adult life in this natural gas society.
People may think I’m crazy about natural gas.  The truth is, I’m crazy about America.  I’m crazy about our economy, our health, and our security.  For these reasons, I guess you could say I’m crazy about natural gas."

The goal of Coins to date has been multi-fold: to encourage developers to build for the Amazon Kindle platform, to reduce the “sticker shock” of paying for things in dollars (something which Android users seem especially sensitive to in comparison with their iOS counterparts), and to increase the revenue generating opportunities for both developers and Amazon.
The idea is to get consumers to think of paying for purchases not as “99 cent” downloads, but rather a number of Coins which they deduct from a bigger stockpile. It’s an idea that’s a holdover from console and PC gaming platforms, but one which is not offered today on either Apple or Google’s official app stores.

What does WhatsApp say about Facebook?,almccann,2014-02-20 18:40:42.256000,1,0,[u'almccann'],"Interesting take on the WhatsApp deal:
32 engineers + 450M MUAs + 10% of FB market cap = Facebook under threat?
""So my question is, if Instagram is worth $1 billion, Snapchat is worth $4 billion or $6 billion or whatever, and WhatsApp is worth $19 billion, how much should Facebook be worth? If a team of ten or twenty engineers can pose such a threat to Facebook, doesn’t that imply that Facebook is actually incredibly vulnerable? They are either overpaying for their deals or their business is much weaker than it appears, which in turn implies they are themselves overvalued. To me, it looks like a start-up with a few million dollars in venture funding can topple Facebook.""

James Bailey, a graduate student in economics at Temple University, came up with a clever way to test that theory: he looked at what happened to 19- to 25-year-olds when the Affordable Care Act made it possible for them to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans, beginning in 2010. Those who got the coverage, he found, were two to three times more likely to go into business for themselves. And that increase was largely driven by women, who are generally more risk-averse than men.

"The Conspiracy Theory Is True: Agents Infiltrate Websites Intending To ""Manipulate, Deceive, And Destroy Reputations"" | Zero Hedge",kidmercury,2014-02-25 13:13:57.119000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"And this time we have a pretty slideshow of formerly confidential data prepared by the UK NSA equivalent, the GCHQ, to confirm it, and Edward Snowden to thank for disclosing it. The messenger in this case is Glenn Greenwald, who has released the data in an article in his new website, firstlook.org, which he summarizes as follows: ""by publishing these stories one by one, our NBC reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of YouTube and Blogger, the targeting of Anonymous with the very same DDoS attacks they accuse “hacktivists” of using, the use of “honey traps” (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses. But, here, I want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself."" Call it Stasi for ""Generation Internet.""
Greenwald's latest revelation focuses on GCHQ’s previously secret unit, the JTRIG (Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group).
Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums."

That's something all advertisers should be aware of before they spend a penny on Facebook: Facebook has operated this way for a long time, and has a page for advertisers explaining in more depth why third-party click reporting may not match Facebook's click counts. Essentially, Facebook suggests, if clicks are not measured in exactly the same way over the same time intervals then there will always be discrepancies.
Facebook is different from the rest of the online ad industry, which follows a standard of allowing click audits by third parties like the IAB, the Media Ratings Council or Ernst & Young."

Advertisers pay to reach highly valued online audiences; they use a variety of technologies, many surprisingly ineffective, to find these individuals. Could cryptocurrencies help?

Finally, imagine an online advertising campaign where people who clicked on an advertisement would be given the virtual coins. Small amounts of money might be distributed without friction. If large brands could create their own currencies and allow individuals to participate in this marketplace, they could create consumers who were truly invested, in every sense.

The entire web of advertising would suddenly become a more interesting place. Before, the ads seemed to hunt you, but now you would have reason to hunt for ads. The coins you earned could then be exchanged for branded goods, but they could also be exchanged on an open market, like a kind of penny stock. “Pay consumers for clicks and acquisitions,” says Smith, defining this new kind of model."

Social Commerce will be the new phase of Social Networks,DouglasGan,2014-02-26 10:08:06.926000,1,0,[u'DouglasGan'],"I started using the internet when I was 14. It was 1997.
IRC was the first thing I used on the internet on a Windows 3.1. Before, I played snake and monopoly on DOS when internet for consumers was still a far away dream.
It was 1999, and dot com was really HOT. It attracted me to take up an IT Diploma. By then, still trying to figure out how to build a meaningful company that can impact millions, I started an online web hosting company, sold to Skydio (Webvisions).
In 2002, suffering the brunt of the bubble burst and having businesses shunning away from my 24/7 hosting sales pitch, I converted a big chunk of my servers to host an online forum. I left IRC and moved all my folks to the forum (I was running a few channels on IRC and and IRCOperator on a few servers).
The forum was very promising. It became Alexa's top 2,000 websites globally and had a very strong base of 700,000 members with over 1.6 million threads and 10 million posts created. In 2006, I expanded it to sell DVDs online and started a movie portal similar to RottenTomatoes to complement the sales. It was a big hit. We grew very fast and was eventually sold to StreetDirectory (JobsDB).
By Q3 of 2007, I lost all my money in the stock market in my biggest gamble ever.
In Q4, I started ShowNearby, a location based mobile app that was later sold to Global Yellow Pages.
A story that was relatively untold was the reasons for each of the sale. I wanted to build a Social Network. But Asia's not the place to do that. It's just too difficult. There were a lack of talent, funding and infrastructure.
But today, today's different. Thanks to Friendster and MySpace, Facebook has proven that social works if you really know how to connect people together. Twitter extended that philosophy and built a subset of Facebook. Instagram did something similar. So did Whatsapp.
I founded a company, VanityTrove, together with 5 people. We have been building it for 2 years, had a pivot and various changes in our business model.
Oct 2013, our first Social Platform for Beauty was launched. We continued talking to our users to understand and gather their feedback.
We realised, there's a movement out there. A movement to create vertical social networks that has far more depth. Far more insights, far more engagement and interactions with its users.
A phase where advertisers will take the next 5-8 years figuring out. But will take consumers within the next 36 months to adopt and create an asset base far more valuable than today's social networks.
A stage where content can be truly monetized through booking, commerce and other revenue channels, more than just ads and affiliations.
The influencing power will be the strongest consumer commodity to harness and monetize.
The future, is now."

In the 19th century America embraced the entrepreneurs, and rugged individuals who sought to reinvent themselves by going west. 
Joe Manchin seems to have forgotten who we are. He seems to have forgotten that it was not the bankers or the boy scouts who opened the West, it was the entrepreneurs, and yes, the hucksters, and the speculators, and all manner of flawed characters looking for a place where they could enjoy the relative freedom of the frontier, away from the tentacles of an overreaching government.
He seems to have forgotten that, more than anything else, it was the frenzied speculation of the Gold Rush that led to California becoming a state, the building of roads, churches, and schools throughout California and the development of the transcontinental railroad that bound California to the rest of the United States.  
Senator Manchin says that we must protect innocent people from losing money by speculating in Bitcoin. As far as I know, we did not feel the obligation to protect the 49ers from losing money during the Gold Rush, and the vast majority of them lost everything they had. I would be shocked to learn that a meaningful number of them asked for help, just as I would be shocked to learn that anyone speculating in bitcoin today has asked Senator Manchin for help. 
I agree that America should lead, but we should lead in a way that is consistent with who we are. We have never before been afraid to explore a frontier. Why start now?"

And they probably spent quite a lot of money on it. Now, it’s just a safety video, right? Other airlines would say, just have the stewardesses do it live. But [Virgin CEO] Richard Branson has said that airlines don’t know how to make you feel good, and that airlines make you feel terrible most of the time. The business of flying is sheer misery. So let’s do different things, make people feel better, and have a really nice safety instruction video."""

So, let me introduce to you the new cryptocurrency of Iceland, Auroracoin.
Auroracoin is based on Litecoin, a descendant of the Bitcoin protocol, the foremost cryptocurrency in the world. However, it is started by an “Airdrop” of auroracoins to the Icelandic nation, designed to reach almost every Icelander. This one-time event will create the conditions for Icelanders to start using the currency, by providing them with a start and making them aware of the currency and its possibilities. After the Airdrop, the only way to acquire auroracoins will be through mining and transacting. Auroracoin will mirror the development of Bitcoin in the near to medium term.
The Airdrop will start to take place on March 25th 2014. A national ID database, created by the government will be used for this purpose. Although the thorough registration of the entire Icelandic nation into one database is unfortunate, it creates opportunities to reach a large part of the public through various means. About 330,000 Icelanders will be made able to claim f 31.8 each over the following year.

The myth of the fall by Eric Raymond,rikardlinde,2014-03-04 18:25:04.394000,1,1,[u'rikardlinde'],"""before the early to mid-1980s, the technological and cultural base to support anything like what we now call “open source” largely didn’t exist at all outside of those two settings. The reason is brutally simple: software wasn’t portable! You couldn’t do what you can do today, which is write a program in C or Perl or Ruby or Python with the confident expectation that it will run on multiple architectures.""
""Not only was portability across architectures a near-impossible dream, you often couldn’t port between instances of the same machine without serious effort. Especially on larger machines, code tended to be intertwined with details of individual site configuration to an extent that would shock people today (IBM JCL was notoriously the worst offender, but by no means the only). In that kind of environment, arguing about whether code should be redistributable in general was next to pointless, because unless the new machine was specifically designed to be binary-compatible with the old, ports amounted to being re-implementations anyway.""
""The Unix guys showed us the way out, by (a) inventing the first non-assembler language really suitable for systems programming, and (b) proving it by writing an operating system in it. But they did something even more fundamental — they created the modern idea of software systems that are cleanly layered and built from replaceable parts, and of re-targetable development tools."""

Some key takeaways from the post:
There’s a huge disconnect between what universities teach and what employers need. A college degree is a highly inefficient way for one to prove job qualification and for employers to evaluate it. These are problems for both employers and students/job seekers.
Employers spend massive amounts of money on training and recruiting and people spend massive amounts of money on education. Tuition inflation and the internet are major forces changing the industry. 
If companies started universities it could be great for students/job seekers as well as a big revenue opportunity and cost saving for companies. A more effective way for people to prove job qualifications and for employers to evaluate could drastically change the higher education industry.

Finally, two years ago, I founded my latest company, SimpleRelevance.
Through each career move, I’ve learned the value of practicing an intentional business strategy. Putting short and long-term goals against decisions and challenging my own choices has been the best way for each of my companies to pivot and evolve.

Many of the cashiers who are the default sales persons for the product are not pushing it. When asked why, employees say it's too early and they have no confidence that Target really has secure their guests data.
Management is upset and they are of course doing ""coaching"" (writing people up) over the issue.
If employees are terminated could they agrue they were unsure they were violating applicable Banking, Lending, SEC, finacial instrument rules and laws?
On the flip side could managers who are not company officers ( and not covered by misconduct insurance) be opening themselves up to litigation?

Some people might instead reference a profile on a more industry specific network such as Behance for creatives or Doximity for doctors. Others use a personal home page provider like about.me and an even smaller fraction have their own domain. This is a pretty unsatisfactory state of the world from both an individual and a service creator perspective.
As an individual, you are never really in control of your identity. In every case other than your own domain a centralized service provider decides what can and cannot be on your profile and can also revoke your profile at any time (most terms of service give the provider nearly complete control). Even with your own domain there is a risk that it could be seized and your identity wiped out.
As a service creator, you can either let users authenticate with one of the big centralized providers or revert to signing in with username/email and a password (where email for most people is right back at large service provider). How much information you then receive about the person and the format for that information is controlled by the authentication provider.

There is an overwhelming amount of innovation occurring in the cryptocurrency space. I mean that literally - it’s quite difficult to parse and understand each of the “alternative” projects being built on top of and/or around the Bitcoin blockchain.
To that end, I present a primer on what I believe are the 5 most interesting endeavors:

Untapped capabilities BTC protocol itself, including smart property, scripting and proposed payments request mechanism
NameCoin
Mastercoin
Ethereum
Ripple

An understanding of these projects allows for a more coherent view on some major questions the cryptocurrency community is addressing. What other problems require a mechanism for distributed consensus? How should identity work in the cryptocurrency world? Should scripting be Turing-complete, or is that overkill? How flawed is BTC’s proof of work, and what other options are there? What does a future of distributed autonomous organizations look like?
I’ll offer my opinions in future posts, but the purpose of this research is to present an unbiased introduction to the technologies and some arguments from people far smarter than I am. To the latter point, the bottom of the document lists some of the best blog posts around these ideas.
In defense of my selection of what to highlight: I am interested in projects that, to an end-user, most differentiate themselves from our current use of Bitcoin as a “simple” currency. So, for example, while LiteCoin and PeerCoin have meaningful technical differences from Bitcoin (mining hardware and proof of stake, respectively), what they enable the end-user to do is not nearly as exciting as the AppCoins of Mastercoin or full Turing-complete scripting capabilities of Ethereum. Similar logic applies in many other cases, but I am happy to persuaded otherwise.

As the two sides cleared the pitch I saw Tottenham’s motto To Dare is To Do.
I am putting that motto to practice as I leave to start my first day of full time work at Wharfie, your local same day delivery concierge, here in Dallas, TX.
About a month ago, I contemplated what my family and I gone through since I returned from Iraq in late 2011 and I failed to secure full employment.
I have worked as a cars salesman (3X) women’s shoe salesman at Nordstorm, parking cars at golf tournaments and cashier at Target. None of these paid enough for my family to live together, under one roof (ours or someone else’s). In the end we lost our house, savings, cars and ultimately all our worldly goods after we could not pay the storage fee. While all that was going on, I did a short stint in the VA hospital to get treated for PTSD.
So on February 15th I decided to stop being a victim. I chose to take advantage of my tax return and regain control of my life. I put my notice in at Target, found a 1 bedroom apartment through my driver from Iraq and found another startup founder, who is a veteran, to split the rent with.
I’ll be using a bike, Uber and RelayRides to get around.
Through a tweet I was informed about a collaboration space called The Garage that was accepting applications. I was one of 5 companies chosen from 70 to receive mentoring, assistance with sales or funding.
My family does not understand why I am leaving a sure thing like Target (25-30 hours a week , $10 HR) for something that is not guaranteed. I know I will have to make up the loss income through freelance work, but in the long run, I feel a better outcome will be reached.
I hope to see some of you at this year’s TechStars Patriot Bootcamp in NYC May 16- 18, 2014, at Goldman Sachs and help other veterans build great companies."

Amazon is larger than the next dozen largest e-tailers—COMBINED! Its resulting scale advantages are staggering. And they aggressively re-invest the benefits of this scale into even lower prices and faster, cheaper shipping that in turn lead to growth and further scale advantages.
So how do you compete with Amazon? In this post the author lists some strategies that he's seeing in the market from both offline and online retailers. Not all are mutually exclusive—i.e., many companies deploy multiple strategies:

A quick recap: 

Fred's post on networks mutualizing.
Brad's thoughts on competing with established networks through innovation in ownership and governance instead of features.
Naval's post on the Bitcoin model for crowdfunding. 
David Johnston's white paper on Decentralized Applications.

Assuming the following scenario, I have a number of questions that I'd love insight on.
A company for knowledge sharing across a network wants to implement some form of mechanism that will enable users who create value to participate in the organization's upside. 
The concept of a mutual company or co-op presents legal, funding, and other challenges. 
A completely decentralized company may not make sense in the earliest years as some central governance and control can help as the network scales.   One possible solution that's appealing is to start with a centralized company that creates a fixed amount of currency, call it Wikicoin. Instead of mining the currency, the organization distributes Wikicoin to network participants as they contribute to the network (creating content, curating, etc.). Governance is determined based on share of Wikicoin ownership and so overtime, as the network scales, governance and oversight becomes increasingly distributed. Perhaps in parallel the organization can move down a path toward being a fully decentralized application as predetermined milestones are crossed.
Questions based on this scenario:
(A) Assuming that in the short term the only use of Wikicoin is to trade it via exchanges, what does this mean from a regulatory perspective? Is Wikicoin simply a proxy for shares in the organization?
(B) Since Wikicoin isn't associated in the short term with transactions that have monetary value (such as buying and selling storage on a decentralized storage service with Boxcoin) the transaction costs of using an existing protocol become problematic. Are there solutions to this that don't require investments into infrastructure such as wallets and exchanges?
(C) If the organization raises investment to help build the network, does it do it via a sale of currency or via ownership in the organization? If via ownership in the organization, what's the end game that creates the liquidity and return?

1. is there a distributed ledger just like BTC?   
2. XRP is destroyed with each transaction. is there a ""destruction log""?
3. how is the cost of XRP destruction dealt with? meaning suppose i do an XRP transaction and some XRP are destroyed in the process. how can it be ensured that the XRP destroyed cannot be re-acquired and/or fabricated? i am assuming (perhaps falsely) that there must be some type of validation going on, and that this validation has a cost. i am trying to understand the cost and who is bearing it. 
4. XRP are deleted with each transaction, and the supply is fixed. does this mean XRP could some day reach zero? if so, does anyone know what happens then?

I don't have actual data so I am just eyeballing things. I am curious if people agree with my observations, if they have other observations and how they feel about these things.
1. Posts in the morning are significantly more likely to rise to the top.
2. The ranking algorithm uses comments almost exclusively with upvotes being a tie breaker, yet people still upvote. 
3. The weekends get fewer posts and comments.
4. Once a USV partner comments on something, there tends to be more comments from other people. They tend to ""seed"" conversations well. (counter point is that these post topics are just more interesting and causation flows the other way)
5. If you modeled out the number of comments on a post with a markov chain, the hardest jump would probably be from 0 to 1. There would probably also be a tipping point around 3 comments that made the post more likely than not to get more comments. 
6. Show / Ask USV tends to be one of the best ways for people who typically don't have top posts, to get them.
7. Readers will not click through links that are not near the top (even before the harsher recent visual hierarchy)
8. Readers will click through posts that are top posts from several days earlier. 
9. When regulars, especially USV team members, do not comment or share links, it tends to be a slow day. "

Hackonomics: A First-of-Its-Kind Economic Analysis of the Cyber Black Markets,AnujAdhiya,2014-03-27 13:14:47.373000,1,0,[u'AnujAdhiya'],"The world of cybercrime is deep, complex, and, according to a new report released today from the RAND Corporation, has become a fully developed market economy.
Some of the key findings include:

Economic Maturity: The hacker black market mirrors that of other free markets in both evolution and growth. RAND found five key indicators of economic maturity, including sophistication, specialization, accessibility, reliability and resilience.
More Profitable than Drug Trade: RAND’s report suggests the cyber black markets are a maturing, multi-billion-dollar economy, with robust infrastructure and social organization. In fact, RAND found the black market can be more profitable than the illegal drug trade. The links to end-users on the black market are more direct and worldwide distribution, being electronic, is trivial.
Rise of Twitter: In any traditional market, the yield or scarcity of a product influences its price. RAND found product prices on the illicit market are no different. Traditionally, credit card information was the currency of the black market, demanding high prices, ranging from $20-$40. However, high-profile breaches have created a recent influx of available credit card data. As a result, the scarcity and value of the stolen credit card information is decreasing. At the same time, social media and other online accounts are increasing in value due to scarcity on the market and a greater payoff for cyber criminals.  RAND found hacking into accounts like Twitter can generate per-account revenues of $16 to $325+ depending on the account type.
Implications for Those Defending: One of the most disturbing and surprising findings from RAND is the increasingly rapid maturity of the market. RAND believes the ability to attack will outpace the ability for companies to defend. Juniper believes we must change the economics of hacking. Using forms of Active Defense like intrusion deception to actively identify, disrupt and frustrate attackers is a very promising approach.

A Life of 4th Downs,JayDengVC,2014-03-27 20:18:37.281000,1,0,[u'JayDengVC'],"Being a big football nut, I was ecstatic when I came across a video about a very unconventional high school football coach:
http://youtu.be/AGDaOJAYHfo
So just how unconventional is Coach Kelley? He never punts the ball. And I really mean NEVER. Every 4th down he goes for it. He also does an onside kick on every kickoff, no exceptions.
Granted this is high school football where a lot of crazy tactics are being pulled off, this is by far the craziest of them all. Entertaining any thoughts of such insanity would give NFL coaches the jitters.
But this is precisely why it works so well.
If there is something I have learned from reading Malcolm Gladwell’s book, The Outliers (which just so happens to be mentioned in the video) is that being different and on the fringes is why some people reach great heights of success.
Growing up as a poor kid, I knew exactly what it meant to be different and not just from a socioeconomic perspective, but from a much bigger one.
My parents didn’t have much - they owned a small Italian restaurant that provided the bare necessities of life but ironically enough, I actually had very little to eat, especially during lunchtime. My mom worked 12 hour days so she had no time to fix me a lunch.
Even worse, we didn’t have much money so I had terrible lunches. I remember sitting next to my friends while they ate their generously proportioned Oscar Mayer Lunchables as I stared at my stale hot dog, the most common meal I had for lunch.
Sometimes the hot dog would be missing and I had just the bun. Other times it would be the opposite. I don’t know if my mom was playing a cruel joke on me or not, but this was just the way it was back then.
It got so unbearable to the point where I was repulsed enough to forgo fulfilling the most basic function of life - eating.
But just like Coach Kelley, when the bare necessities of life are being stripped away from you, you are forced to navigate the wilderness of life foraging whatever you can to survive.
I did just that.
I use to hangout at the nearby Safeway, reading magazines off the rack. I cherished those moments the most because it was a chance for me to escape the harsh realities of my childhood. I would lose myself in the pages of Motor Trend, staring at photos of luxury cars I would one day aspire to drive.
The video game magazines were the most heartbreaking to read because I loved games so much but knew that I would never have a chance to play any of them because I was poor.
Any vestige of a normal video game filled childhood was torn away, page by page.
One day as I was leaving, I noticed an elderly lady exiting the store while gingerly prodding along with her heavily laden cart as others went about their business. It was more than any woman of her age could handle but she persisted, most likely out of stubbornness.
But even as a 9 year old kid, I knew this was wrong. My mom may have given me stale hot dogs, but she also taught me to respect and care for your elders. I approached her offering my assistance which she gladly accepted - after all, who could refuse a bright eyed Chinese kid with a crooked smile?
After assisting the elderly woman to her car, she offered me her shopping cart. I gladly accepted because every cart came with a 25 cent reward (back then, most shopping carts could only be used when a shopper slipped a coin into an attached slot).
As I proudly held that quarter in my hand, I immediately recognized the opportunity. This was my first 4th down moment - when you have nothing to lose and so many quarters to gain.
For the following months, I would repeat this process over and over again.
I redesigned that crooked smile of mine to a one where no sweet old lady could resist. I talked with the swagger of a street urchin shilling newspapers on the corner. The little boy who read magazines, hoping and dreaming of a better life, had stepped back while the man in me had finally stepped forward.
Some days, it would only be a few quarters and others significantly more. The clanging of metal quarters in my pockets became music to my ears.
I still remember the day I brought all my quarters to deposit in my bank. The bank tellers always smiled when I came in because they knew exactly how I got all those shiny coins.
And quarter by quarter (just like a football game!), I ended up getting my first handheld video game system, a Sega Game Gear.
My life since then has been predicated on the 4th down, whether it was asking the cute freckled girl at school for a date or gambling my life savings in day trading, I always did my best to just go for it.
It’s the only way I know how to live life now.
Going for it on every 4th down isn’t just courage, but a mental fortitude that can change the core of who you are.
I think this is why I was so drawn to venture capital and startups. Whether you are making a pitch to investors, or like me, investing in startups, this is a 4th down business.
I know that with every 6 figure investment I make, I can lose it all and end up with nothing. But the fear of stale hot dogs and an empty stomach is what compels me to keep going for it on 4th down.
As I look back at all the 4th down moments in my life, I am easily reminded of those times when I failed to convert. But I am also reminded of those times that I did go for it and succeeded. Now I am approaching the scrimmage line of my next and most daunting 4th down attempt: starting my own VC firm.
Am I terrified? You bet. But 4th down forces you to become more - to strive, reach and be unyielding in the face of failure.
I wouldn’t have it any other way."

Drones Have Come to Same Day Delivery,billmcneely,2014-03-28 18:56:55.044000,3,0,"[u'billmcneely', u'kidmercury', u'bradleyjoyce']"," 
 
Back in November of  2013  the world buzzed for a solid week when Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes did a piece on Amazon with delivery drones. Most thought Prime Air was a publicity stunt and the plaything of an eccentric billionaire. That eccentric billionaire Jeff Bezos  seem to admit in the piece that the service would not be ready for 4 or 5 years.
 
What a difference 6 months make.
 
The biggest hurdle, The FAA was neutralized back on March 4th. A judge with the NTSB administrative court ruled the FAA did not properly follow procedure when making guidelines to ban commercial drones in 2007.
 
Most parties agree that commercial drones, for the time being, need to fly below 500 feet and carry less than 5 pounds in cargo.
 
Drones are moving away from the RC technology of old and to coding/GPS to guide them to delivery drop off points. This means instead of 1 operator to 1 drone you could have 1 operator monitor several drones through on board sensor/video feeds since each machine is pre programmed with delivery coordinates.
 
Concerns that still need to be addressed are:


Guarding against theft of cargo


Vandalism of the drone


all weather/season capability


Increasing range through better batteries


Easier battery swap out


Advances in Motor/Propellers to ensure lift capabilities of over 5 pounds


 
The cost of drones to make these types of deliveries is relatively low. Two examples. The 3D Robotics X8 with a cargo load of 2.2 pounds and stay aloft time is 12 minutes starts at $1,350. Meanwhile, Ctrl.me’s DJI S1000 carries 6-8 securely for 24 minutes starting at $3,300.
 
Pay back on the Ctrl.me S1000 model could be had in just 42 days ( 660 trips at 16 trips a day at $5 per trip )
 
In addition to Ctrl.me and 3D Robotics another respected startup drone companies like Skycatch Sky Futures
 
Besides Amazon Prime Air in the Same Day Delivery drone space are QuiQui. QuiQui delivers prescription drugs in The Mission neighborhood of San Francisco.
 
My startup Wharfie is even looking into the possibility here in Dallas.
 
The days when overnight delivery seemed crazy fast is a thing of the distant past       like the VCR.

Facebook found during testing that users who were switched to the new News Feed tended to spend less time on the site.
Facebook’s data team discovered that the new News Feed was performing too well. It was performing so well from a design standpoint that users no longer felt the need to browse areas outside of the News Feed as often, so they were spending less time on the site. Unfortunately, this change in user behavior led to fewer advertisement impressions, which led, ultimately, to less revenue.
So the question is: do you take the risk and proceed with the better user experience/product at the expense of short term numbers–with no promise that the better design will actually lead to long-term benefits–or do you scrap the new design and start over?"
The Economist explains: The startup explosion,AnujAdhiya,2014-04-01 10:59:14.314000,1,0,[u'AnujAdhiya'],"The main reason for this “startup explosion”, as it has come to be known, is that the basic building blocks for digital services and products—the “technologies of startup production”, if you will—have become so flexible, cheap and ubiquitous that they can be easily combined and recombined: snippets of code, cloud-computing and other services and the internet itself, which is now fast, universal and wireless.
As a result, startups can be lean: they no longer need to operate their own servers; they can outsource much of what they do, from software development to user testing; and they can iterate constantly to improve their product.
During the dotcom boom launching a startup was a big bet on a business plan; now it is only the first of a series of experiments, an ongoing exploration."

As a result, we’re engaging in increasingly careful identity sculpting in the social environments we inhabit.
This return to anonymous communities is fascinating. We yearn for true connection with one another, conducted safely and on our own terms. Some of us will use the cover of privacy to sling mud or rumors, but others will find a safe haven for airing deeply felt concerns or desires. As with most technologies, the app itself is agnostic in this regard—it’s what we choose to do with it that’s interesting and open to either praise or criticism."

We invest in internet-based businesses, share our opinions on usv.com and personal blogs, and fight for the internet’s continued freedom. You can find the most recent iteration of our investment thesis here. So it makes sense that, when the time is right, we turn to the internet to help us find talented individuals to join our team. In this vein, I'm excited to announce that USV is hiring an investment analyst. The start date for this position will be sometime after Memorial Day.
The analyst position at Union Square Ventures is a two-year role based in New York City. As an analyst at USV, you'll learn what the venture capital business is about and gain insight into many fascinating technology startups. Our past analysts have launched a seed fund, joined one of our portfolio companies, joined another venture firm and worked on their own start-up.
The ideal candidate would be equally interested in working at a startup as in venture capital. We are open to candidates ranging from soon-to-be college graduates to candidates with a graduate degree and/or several years of relevant work experience.
The primary responsibility of the analyst is to help manage the day-to-day activities of the firm, including:


Performing market research and due diligence for potential investments, which could entail financial or web-analytics modeling, or testing products and services


Meeting with entrepreneurs who have started businesses in which USV may be interested in investing


Reporting for our investors, which includes helping to set companies' valuations, writing quarterly updates, and packaging the material for our investors


Working with USV portfolio companies, including research projects, competitor analysis, valuation work, and attending board meetings


Designing and executing projects of your own direction that help USV and/or our portfolio companies


We're looking for someone who demonstrates:


Deep understanding of the ecosystem of web and mobile services


Familiarity with web technologies


Strong drive and the ability to self-direct - your work and time is open-ended by nature and you must be able to identify and execute on opportunities to contribute to the team with little, if any, management or direction


Strong written and oral communication skills - well-defended opinions are a necessity


Strong interpersonal skills - you'll often be talking to entrepreneurs and other investors on behalf of USV


Strong organizational skills - you’ll be keeping track of documents for a large portfolio of investments


Comfort modeling in Excel and working in Google Docs


Comfortable in a small, relatively unstructured office environment


Ideally, some prior design or programming experience, or work in an investment or internet-related position


Our application has two parts:  
First, we're looking to see links that will help us get to know you. This could be your personal blog, Tumblr, Github profile or Twitter account - whatever represents you best. We expect your web presence to represent who you are, not who you think an employer wishes you were, so please don't waste time sanitizing your web presence before sending us there. We get it.
Second, we'd also like to hear from you directly, so we're asking each applicant to record two short videos answering these questions: ""Why are you interested in the analyst role at Union Square Ventures?"" (up to a 90-second response) and ""Which web or mobile services most inspire you?"" (up to a 120-second response). We're using Ziggeo to collect the video responses securely and privately.
To apply, visit usv.com/apply. You will need a Twitter account to log in. None of the information you submit will be shared outside of USV. We'll be accepting applicants until 11:59pm Eastern time on Tuesday, April 1st.
If you have questions, please leave them in the comments below. Otherwise, we're looking forward to hearing about what you find compelling, what you've made, how you think, and why you're into what we do."

This is why these abstract patents are such terrible weapons in the hands of patent trolls. It does not matter that no one can figure out if the idea should be patentable, it just matters that someone in the Patent Office let it through. Then it does not matter if no one can figure out what companies might be infringing, it only matter is a patent troll's lawyers might be able to convince a jury that it does. 
If all the smart people on the Supreme Court can't draw this line, they should realize that a narrow ruling that leaves these abstract software patents intact will do nothing to protect innovative software companies from the onslaught of patent trolls. We should stop this madness now."

High-frequency trading is a growing cancer that needs to be addressed | Charles Schwab,kidmercury,2014-04-03 10:29:32.890000,2,1,"[u'kidmercury', u'pointsnfigures']"," 
Here are examples of the practices that should concern us all:

Advantaged treatment: Growing numbers of complex order types afford preferential treatment to professional traders’ orders, most notably to jump ahead of retail limit orders.
Unequal access to information: Exchanges allow high-frequency traders to purchase faster data feeds with detailed information about market trading activity and the specific trading of various types of market participants. This further tilts the playing field against the individual investor, who is already at an informational disadvantage by virtue of the slower Consolidated Data Stream that brokers are required by rule to purchase or, even worse, the 15- to 20-minute-delayed quote feed they have public access to.
Inappropriate use of information: Professionals are mining the detailed data feeds made available to them by the exchanges to sniff out and front-run large institutions (mutual funds and pension funds), which more often than not are investing and trading on behalf of individual investors.
Added systems burdens, costs and distortions of rapid-fire quote activity: Ephemeral quotes, also called “quote stuffing,” that are cancelled and reposted in milliseconds distort the tape and present risk to the resiliency and integrity of critical market data and trading infrastructure.  The tremendous added costs associated with the expanded capacity and bandwidth necessary to support this added data traffic is ultimately borne in part by individual investors.

There are solutions. Today there is no restriction to pumping out millions of orders in a matter of seconds, only to reverse the majority of them. It’s the life-blood of high-frequency trading. A simple solution would be to establish cancellation fees to discourage the practice of quote stuffing. The SEC and CFTC floated the idea last year. It has great merit. Make the fees high enough and they will eliminate high-frequency trading entirely. But if the practice is simply a scam, as we believe it is, an even better solution is to simply make it illegal. And exchanges should be neutral in the market. They should stop the practice of selling preferential access or data feeds and eliminate order types that allow high-frequency traders to jump ahead of legitimate order flow. These are all simply tools for scamming individual investors.
The integrity of the markets is at the heart of our economy. High-frequency trading undermines that integrity and causes the market to lose credibility and investors to lose trust. This hurts our economy and country. It is time to treat the cancer aggressively.

My question for USV.com is can/will networks eventually become unbundled? To clarify...
Networks bundle a few value propositions for supply side: payments, software platform, access to demand, etc. Networks have to serve both sides of the marketplace (which could even create some conflicts of interest). For the demand side, the networks provides access to supply, quality assurance/curation, a presentation medium, etc.  
Unblunding means delivering a small component of a larger offering at a lower price and with greater specialization. It seems companies are beginning to compete on many of these value propositions individually, mostly serving supply sides. For example:
 
Youtube-->Wistia
Tumblr-->Wordpress
Udemy-->Fedora
 
Google (access to customers)
Gumroad (payments)
Glance/Quarterly (curation)
Affilate networks (access to customers)
 
Can/will all the value propositions of a network become unbundled? In other words, if Kickstarter isn’t providing me with access to backers, why shouldn’t I pay for a software platform and/or payments alone at a lower transaction fee? If I’m acquiring all the customers for my book why do I need Amazon and the quality assurance and competition/pricing pressure that comes with it? If I have the software, why not just form a deal with an affilate marketing team or buy some Google Adwords to get access to customers?
What would prevent unbundling? Under what dynamics would unbundling prevail over networks and vice versa?
Will markets become segmented between unbundled solutions and networks? For example, some people want access to customers so they would use Udemy, but others just need the software so they would use Fedora. If so, does that make networks less attractive?

The Reddit community, predictably, is pretty dubious about the investment and fears that what made Imgur attractive (simple and fast image hosting) will fade as efforts to monetize and grow Imgur's own social community ramps up. I would imagine that the large investment will likely be used to improve Imgur's social aspect."

How Long Should A Blog Post Be - The Definitive Answer,JaysonFeltner,2014-04-04 10:34:47.550000,2,0,"[u'JaysonFeltner', u'robbnotes']","o grow your blog, there are very few things you must do.  If your traffic isn’t rapidly growing, you’re missing one or more of these important things.  Don’t worry; this post will detail exactly what the top 30 bloggers in the world do to grow their traffic.
We’ve conducted extensive research on the top 30 bloggers in the world.  To do so, we used this list of the top 50 blogs in the world.  We ruled out the blogs that had multiple authors, since they were really just online magazines.  What’s left is priceless data that you can use on your own platform to become a world-class blogger with all the traffic that comes with it.
The first topic every blogger wants to know is, “How long should my posts be?”  This question is all over the internet with no definitive answer.
Michael Hyatt, a blogger on the top 30 list is an advocate for 500 word posts.  Seth Godin has made an insane impact on the world 40 words at a time.  Timothy Ferriss, author of The 4 Hour Work Week, has built a tremendous online presence, 5,000 words at a time.
With all these successful bloggers writing posts anywhere from 40 to 5000 words, how is a new blogger supposed to know what to do?
Here is your answer to “how long should a post should be?”
450 Words – Of the 30 bloggers we researched, 20 bloggers averaged 450 words.
1800 Words - The other 10 bloggers averaged 1800 words per post.  This proves that it is possible to build a highly successful blog by writing long, intense and very deep posts.  However, our study shows you’d be two times more likely to succeed writing shorter, more frequent posts.
Scannable – The consensus among top bloggers is that your posts should be scannable and easily read.  Use bulleted or numbered lists in your posts.
Frequency - The 20 bloggers who posted 450-word posts averaged 3 posts per week with some delivering multiple posts per day.
The objective of a short post is for the reader to consume small amounts of easily digested information on a frequent basis.  This increases a bloggers overall exposure by releasing more potential landing points on search engines.  Studies also show that shorter posts are less intimidating and tend to be read more frequently. This post is an example from one of the top 2 bloggers in the world."

The total amount of cash raised before IPO has doubled from the '98 cohort, adjusted for inflation.

Executive functions (EF) imply processes critical for purposeful, goal-directed behavior. In children, evidence derived from laboratory measures indicates that training can improve EF. However, this hypothesis has never been explicitly examined based on real-world measures, especially of educational achievement. Here, we investigate whether a set of computerized games might yield transfer on low-socioeconomic status otherwise typically developing 6-y-olds in an intervention deployed at their own school. The games elicit transfer of some EF, which cascades to real-world measures of school performance. More importantly, the intervention equalizes academic outcomes across children who regularly attend school and those who do not because of social and familiar circumstances."

There are two camps in the blogging world.  One camp is made up of 20 of the top 30 bloggers.  These bloggers prefer short and frequent posting.  The other camp is made up of the other 10 bloggers.  This camp prefers long, infrequent posting.
So which group is right?
How often should you blog, is only answered by your style of blogging.  While 8000 world blog posts can help you grow your blog, evidence shows that shorter, 450 word blog posts tend to work better.
For the sake of all bloggers, both long and short, we’ll address blogging frequency for each style.

It happens to all of us. Sometimes, the right way to fix a project is to cancel it. Making the decision to do so, though, has to be more than a gut response.
Perhaps the project team thought this was a good idea, sure to take off… but, well, it didn’t work out that way. Or someone in Management “suggested” your group take this on – but nobody took a critical item into account. Or the project seems to be stalled at “80% done” forever.
Whatever the reason – at some point, you have to decide whether to keep plugging along, or to pull the plug.

The Private Automatic Miner Backbone Protocol,databigbang,2014-04-20 10:02:48.734000,1,0,[u'databigbang'],"The need for direct connection between the main miner pools or solo-miners was discussed several times in the forums and in this blog during the last two years. A miner backbone provides not only benefits to the network as a whole, but benefits for those miners that establish such connections. A backbone decreases the chances of blocks being orphaned, so miners also have a strong incentive to have direct connections between them and announce a solved block as soon as possible. This is one of the fundamental properties of the 5 second block rate solution adopted by NimbleCoin and the MinCen protocol. Also the network benefits from the backbone because a backbone decreases the probability of a black-chain split between two competing subnets because of an accidental or deliberate loss of connectivity. There are several possible attacks to the Bitcoin network widely analyzed that try to isolate nodes, such as the Sybil attack or the Timejacking attack. A direct backbone would allow miners to either go around the attacked nodes or detect if the other miners are unreachable and therefore they are being isolated. A backbone can be created manually: two mining pool administrators meet in an IRC channel, they convince each other that they are who they say they are, they convince each other what their hashing power is, they exchange PGP public keys, they verify the public keys in a public keystore, and finally they exchange encrypted and signed e-mails containing their IP addresses. This “solution” has many drawbacks as follows:"

The Secret To Higher Google Rankings,JaysonFeltner,2014-04-21 10:17:32.380000,1,0,[u'JaysonFeltner'],"This is your guide to higher Google rankings.
Create great content.  Try to write posts that add value to others.  Google doesn’t have people reading your site and grading your content, but they can tell how good your content is based on how others use it on the web.  As such, great content is always treated the same.  People share it, they tweet it, they post it around the web, they visit it repeatedly.  All this action, will tell Google that your content is valuable.
Be consistent with your delivery.  Writers with higher Google rankings deliver content consistently.  Many people choose to publish content daily when they’re trying to grow a platform.  This isn’t always necessary, but not a bad idea.  What separates the pros from the hobbyists is consistently publishing content.  I recently published a post about how often you should blog.
Do optimize your content for SEO. Google’s algorithms are dependent on keywords and they recognize that they need your help to find those keywords.  I personally prefer using Scribe SEO. Scribe: More Traffic and Leads, Less Time and Hassle.  It analyzes my content and shows me how to present it in such a way that Google will be able to easily recognize the subject of my posts.
Do NOT us black hat tactics.  Black hat tactics are those “shortcuts” that others are trying to sell you.  In some cases, they will work… for a little while.  However, Google will catch it sooner or later, and when they do, they will penalize your site.  In other words, do not give up your long term rankings for higher Google rankings in the short term.
Google’s algorithms are designed to view your site on a comprehensive level, considering all aspects of your online presence, and then make a determination of how valuable your site is.  The more value your site adds to the web, the higher Google rankings you’ll achieve.  As in most aspects of life, the tried and true method is still the best option.  Now, you can finally find peace in the fact that your long term strategy will work out if you stay the course."

Given the civil uprising in Ukraine, the telephone companies reported the location of people to the government so they knew precisely who was in Maidan. Yanukovich then sent SMS text messages to everyone there bluntly stating“you are registered as a participant in a mass disorder” and this actually inspired people to continue knowing if they stopped, they would be jailed and probably tortured. The mobile provider in Ukraine actually belonged to Russians. After the fact, of course, everyone from the police to the mobile provider denies sending this SMS.

I was pretty dismissive in my response to Shana. I told her that USV was “all in” on Kickstarter and we did not want to invest in anything that was too close to them. And though I did not mention it to Shana, I was also wondering how someone like Edward could manage being an entrepreneur in combination with all of the other things he does. But Shana is persistent. I took the breakfast which was at Pain Quotidien on 5th Avenue and 8th Street.
I walked into that breakfast a skeptic and came out a believer. Edward impressed me with his commitment to making it easier to raise funds for charities and causes. And he impressed me with his knowledge of startups and technology.
In the three+ years since, I have recommended CrowdRise to everyone who asks me where to crowdfund for charities. Each time I send them to Edward, he and his co-founders Shauna, Robert, and Jeffrey have treated them well and helped them run successful campaigns on CrowdRise.
Last fall, we met again for breakfast. This time at Maialino. And Edward told me they had an incredible year in 2013 and had recently been approached by a buyer who wanted to acquire CrowdRise. I told him “absolutely not”. So Edward said “what would you do if you were me?” and I replied “I would raise a big round from top notch VCs and grow CrowdRise into the crowdfunding platform for charities”.
And, as all of you must realize as you read this, that is exactly what Edward, Shauna, Robert, and Jeffrey did. Today CrowdRise is announcing a large investment by USV, Index, Spark, RatPac Entertainment , Bezos Expeditions, and the talent agencies CAA and UTA.
At USV, we believe that the best crowdfunding services are domain specific. Kickstarter for project funding, Lending Club for consumer debt, CircleUp for equity investments in consumer products, Funding Circle for small business debt, and so on and so forth.

Continued growth of the sharing economy and p2p marketplaces necessitates a global distributed and repurposable (real name/pseudonymous/anonymous) trust and reputation system. A mechanism is needed which will allow strangers to gauge whether to interact/transact with each other across 'n' services and use-cases. Trusted Identities would engender trade, relationships, serendipity and more.
A possible solution:
Proof of burn represents a sacrifice of value in order to establish a trusted identity. By making a trusted identity expensive to obtain it can be trusted not to engage in bad behaviour, as doing so would cause the identity to become destroyed if tarnished thereby rendering the sacrifice and identity useless.
Third parties can easily verify the value sacrificed to establish your trusted identity and use it as a proxy to decide whether to:
1) rent their room to you on Airbnb
2) go on a date with you after meeting you on Tinder
3) accept you for a ride on Lyft
4) back your projects on Kickstarter
5) loan you money through crowdlending
etc etc.
MVP:
A  web app which generates a verifiably unspendable bitcoin address to which you would send an arbitrary amount of btc (proof of burn). The service would then link the transaction hash of the payment to an existing online identity of your choosing and provide you a profile page which acts as public proof of your trusted identity.
In the event of bad behaviour, aggrieved parties can leave public comments on your proof page for others to see. The service itself would not blacklist your identity based on negative feedback, merely display it for others to judge as they see fit. (Third party services could create blacklists off the data much in the same way SpamAssassin and others do to IP addresses). Over time you create a global trust network with serious emergent behaviour potential.

Amazon Exposes the Flaws in Net Neutrality Arguments,kidmercury,2014-04-28 12:58:54.714000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"Boy Genius Report recently revealed that Amazon is working on something called Prime Data. Details are scarce due to Amazon's secrecy, but one reasonable speculation is that this plan will afford all Amazon Prime subscribers free mobile data access to Amazon apps from Amazon computers.
Let's assume this story is true. If it is, doesn't this violate the concept of net neutrality? Amazon will be providing its apps for free, while other forms of data will be relegated to a second tier. 
In my opinion, this is exactly how the Internet should evolve. This innovation reveals how ecosystems are paradoxically becoming more fragmented and more integrated at the same time. Prime Data constitutes one more step towards AmazonNet -- a distinct Internet governed by Amazon -- while also creating a more integrated experience for Amazon customers. 
Moreover, let's remember that Amazon already has AWS, which powers a significant portion of what we regard as the Internet. This enables Amazon to more closely track all steps of the data transmission, which could lead to improved performance for users. The split architecture of the Amazon Silk browser is an example of one such innovation. 
Consider how this may develop as we progress further in the blockchain era. Suppose Amazon can further reduce transmission costs for data in its realm (i.e. on AWS servers or on Kindle Fire computers) by leveraging blockchain technology so that Kindle Fire computers share their excess computing resources to help deliver and authenticate files. This is something Amazon might not be able to do at all with data that is outside of its ecosystem; it is an innovation borne out of Amazon's efforts at creating a deeply integrated ecosystem. Net neutrality could hinder the ability of the company to leverage such innovations -- innovations I think are consistent with the broader, paradoxical trend of simultaneous fragmentation and integration. 
This is why net neutrality is a flawed concept. The problem it seeks to solve is concentration of ISP power. The legitimacy of that problem is not being disputed here -- only the viability of net neutrality as a means to dispute it is.

House of Twitter Cards: How Twitter’s Monetization Strategy is Coming Together,AnujAdhiya,2014-04-29 12:30:33.240000,1,0,[u'AnujAdhiya'],"Last week, Twitter announced a new way for app developers to drive app installs and engagement through Twitter cards, promoted tweets and the MoPub ad exchange. The pundits responded quickly, calling it a huge win for Twitter even if it’s derivative of the Facebook mobile strategy. As Peter Kafka notes, this has been in the works for some time.
While Twitter appears to have a user growth problem, it continues to monetize well, beating the Street numbers quarter after quarter. Almost all of that revenue comes from promoted tweets, accounts and trends with non-substantial revenue from Twitter cards, according to SEC filings. If that’s the case, then why did Twitter introduce Twitter cards in the summer of 2012?
The author believes that Twitter is like the ambitious protagonists of House of Cards, Frank and Claire Underwood. Like the Underwoods, Twitter has been deliberately working behind the scenes for years. What’s in the cards for Twitter?"

First of all, what is an earnout? An earnout is typically a performance-based payment that has been agreed to be paid to selling shareholders, above and beyond any payments received upfront at closing the deal. For example, let’s say a buyer is willing to pay you $1MM upfront at closing and up to $4MM additional proceeds if your EBITDA exceeds a certain level within one year of closing. That $4MM part of the deal is the earnout portion, which is tied to future performance of the company."

In fact, the work of ""coding"" a computer, as it was originally envisioned, was an inherently feminized occupation: low-status, low-paid, and largely invisible. Today, of course, the situation has almost entirely reversed, and computer programmers have adopted an almost stereotypically masculine identity. The story of the transformation of the ""computer girls"" of the early electronic computer era into the ""IT guys"" of the present period is more than a mere historical curiosity: by highlighting the ways in which the professionalization of computing work also involved the masculinization of its practitioners, it sheds new light on contemporary questions about both the state of the computing professions and the issue of gender in computer science education.""

He arrived in New York City on April 17, 2014 and is currently living with his wife and child in the home of a distant family member in the Bronx until he finds a job.
Faiz is set to meet with his counselor from the International Rescue Committee to start the process of looking for a job and housing on Tuesday.
He recieves a small stipend, but it's really not that much.
Faiz has a high school degree and speaks English well. Having worked with the US Department of Defense and State, US based contractors and I believe the UN, he has average computer skills.
He can handle himself well and has the courage of lion. Most of the interpreters coming over on this particular visa have either been tortured, kidnapped or had a close family member murdered as a direct result of serving OUR country. 
Faiz is fairly young and the Tech sector may be good for him. We already filled out an application for him to be a  WunWun messenger and sent a tweet to it's CEO Lee Hnetinka.
He will need an iPhone, a backpack and a bike but those are easy fixes.
He has a social security number and green card.
Afghans are great people. Like all immigrants they just need a hand up to get intergrated with the culture, then they will be on their way.
If anybody else has any connections to other NYC based crowdsharing businesses let me know or contact him directly through email faizuddinrahimi@yahoo.com

Scan for Unsafe Query Risk in Active Record vulnerability,DougCraver,2014-05-07 18:05:35.586000,1,0,[u'DougCraver'],"Yesterday, a security advisory was issued for documenting an Unsafe Query Risk in Active Record, the core data access technology used in the Ruby on Rails project which powers much of the backend server infrastructure at Mobile Defense. The advisory describes a method by which a malicious user could retrieve data that they ordinarily would be prevented from accessing. Unlike most security advisories, it appears the fix for this vulnerability would be a breaking change. Because of this, the decision was made not to release a patched version of Active Record until the change can be vetted and existing users have a chance to test their code bases with the change applied.
A workaround is available, but it must be applied to each potentially vulnerable line of code, and developers must remember to continue to do so as they write new code that could also trigger the flaw. We determined that a better approach would be to analyze the relations between the underlying data models in our application and determine which, if any, were potentially vulnerable to this flaw. We could then modify our data models to avoid the underlying issue. The biggest advantage to this approach is that once we know our data model is safe we will not have to worry that new code which might trigger the flaw could sneak its way into our code base. We wrote a script to perform this analysis, and located one data model in our application that could potentially be vulnerable. While we have never used it in a way that triggers the flaw, we nonetheless refactored it to ensure that there is no potential to trigger the flaw in the future.
We are sharing this script in the hopes that others may find it helpful in ensuring that their code bases are safe in light of this vulnerability. It detects models and relations that are potentially exploitable by the two scenarios described in the security advisory. In both cases, the best solution is usually to rename the conflicting column. For the second scenario (which relies on relations between models), the script only determines if there is a potentially vulnerable conflict between a table name and the name of an Active Record relation belonging to a model class. It does not attempt to determine if the table can actually be accessed (either directly, or through a chain of relations) from the model class, or if user-supplied parameters are actually being passed in a manner that triggers the flaw. In short, the script will not tell you whether or not you can actually be exploited via this vulnerability today; rather, it tells you whether any models in your application have the potential to be exploited -if- some unsafe code did exist or were to be written in the future.
To use the script, simply clone or download the following Gist and run it in the context of your application with: click here "

Building a company is no different. Billion dollar companies are not built overnight, they are built through a progressive series of steps. If you attempted to envision a billion dollar company from day zero, you would be overwhelmed by the challenge.

And not only is this becoming a problem to the music industry (as probably deserved by the big 3), but it's creating a num scenario for all those artists outside of the top 100's.
Music is going back to the old model of moving hardware, problem here is that with the new hardware it doesn't come new sources of revenue for the artists making the music, what's more, now more than ever their share is approaching $0.00 very rapidly with every transaction, even when they seat in the middle of the biz.
I know it is early still to call the shots on this one, but then again, not even Dr. Dre himself was able to come up with a model that much different from Spotify... or maybe he was not allowed to.
The music industry needs to start embrasing new models to let innovation flourish without asking for millions ahead of time, if they really want to remain alive and well in the near future it will be from entrepreneurs that the answer will come from, not big corps.
When you leave the shots to be called by big ones in other industries, you know you start loosing right from the beginning, as whatever they'll come out with, it will never, truly, be aligned with your own needs and values.

""
'Mr. Wheeler's insistence that his strategy would preserve an open Internet, without previously offering much insight into how, has been a source of disquiet within his agency.

Unless the FCC relies on Title II, it must permit fast lanes, slow lanes, discriminatory exemptions to bandwidth caps and all the other stuff AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon always wanted.
Still, the FCC Chairman keeps suggesting that the FCC can force the carriers to offer the same terms to everyone and can ban fast lanes under Section 706, without relying on Title II. It’s obvious from the January decision that forcing them to offer the same terms would be common carriage and therefore illegal. Any rules not adopted under Title II will either authorize massive network discrimination and “individualized bargaining” between ISPs and all websites—or be struck down.
If we want a rule against discrimination and against new access fees, we need Title II. There is no legal third way."

""RelSci has compiled over two million influential names and their connections, charity work, work and board associates, and education to find pathways between dealmakers, power brokers, and business executives."" Relationship Science cuts through the fluff you might see with user-generated profiles on Linkedin, and attempts to be more objective by scouring public information like SEC filings, etc.
I found the use cases its being used for right now to be interesting.

Nonprofits and Universities to identify donors
Lobbyists to connect with the right Government Officials
Lawyers
Investors
Salespeople / BD

There is an incredible amount of power in insights garnered from such high quality data which Linkedin doesn't come close to, in my opinion. This is evident from the following points.

Goes Deeper with Insights than just Showing How I am Connected - ""I guarantee you and I probably have five things in common we're really passionate about. If I have a tool that helps me discover those things...that's immensely valuable"" 
Determining Strength of an Entire Firm's Relationships - ""One feature, for example, is a helicopter view of entire companies as the sum of their relationships, and how those relationships lead to people in other companies and industries. Where are their connections strong? Where are they weak? And where are the strategic opportunities 95 percent of corporate executives overlook? If they can't see them, perhaps RelSci's algorithms can.""

...self driving cars have become a reality. The car's AI handles all aspects of driving and safety.
The car senses a coming accident and works out avoidance/mitigation options.
Option #1 -Veer left. Kill the driver and save innocent bystanders.
Option #2 - Veer right. Save the driver and kill innocent bystanders.
Who decides what the car does?
 
Does the government enforce standardized protocols based on ulititarian principles?
Can the car manufacturer set protocols to maximise profits?
Can the driver pay a premium to override default protocols to ensure the car values his/her life over all others?
Do hackers materialise to illegally flash the car safety firmware?"

Every dollar they have to return to investors is a dollar that doesn’t go to users of the platform — users who, by the nature of the sharing economy, often feel they’re the ones who created the value in the first place and deserve to partake in it. ‘Those companies won’t be able to get out from under that structure,” Burnham said. “That is an opportunity for the next generation of sharing economy companies. The key is to raise less and raise it at a valuation that allows a return for your investors without having to have a thick platform that extracts a lot of rents for your investors.”"

Social news sites are nothing new. Slashdot was probably the father but since then there have been numerous sites including Digg, del.icio.us, Reddit, and Hacker News. The basic idea is simple: users get to to submit and vote on what content they think belongs on the front page. It is democracy in action with all its benefits and flaws. It works pretty well, but there are obvious issues.



Aside from exposure, good content is not actually rewarded monetarily. In fact, the additional traffic might be more expensive than the exposure is worth.


Since submissions and votes do not actually cost anything aside from time, it is easy to flood the system with noise. Additionally, users are careless and thoughtlessly upvote mediocre content or downvote controversial but worthwhile content.


Forum-style sites are notoriously difficult to monetize.


In a way, it's a marketplace for good content... and I like it."

I’m in the process of revamping the site, and am trying to understand what problems people face while learning new business skills.

We need a regulatory process that knocks down barriers to entry for small start-ups, yet keeps close tabs on ones that operate in legal gray areas and are big enough to do real damage. We need adequate funding for regulators at the FDA, SEC, and other agencies, and forward-thinking leadership that will have them looking at new companies before the battle lines are drawn. In other words, the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley shouldn't be the only ones pushing the envelope — as Airbnb's case shows, we need futuristic thinking from watchdogs, too. """

A new unannounced feature of iOS 8 leaked yesterday which showed that Apple will place installed apps on your home screen based off your location. The examples shown included the Apple Store and Starbucks where if you’re in Starbucks it would place the app on your home screen so you can access it with a simple swipe up on the left of your screen.
As we all know, there are rumors that Apple is exploring the payments space with Tim Cook himself saying that there’s significant interest in what Apple can do there. Apple has over 800 million iTunes accounts with credit cards attached putting them in prime position to take the payments industry head on. I previously wrote about how Apple might use TouchID and iTunes accounts to process e-commerce payments on iOS devices. With the hidden features today, I think we can get a glimpse into how payments would work in the real world.
A quick mockup of how the flow can work. (yes, i’m horrible at Photoshop) With iBeacon, iOS devices can communicate with BLE devices with low energy and at specific distances. And with iOS 8, you can use location services to get the right app in easy reach when you’re at the location where it would be useful. Combine the two, and iOS 8 could potentially bring up an Apple Payments app when you’re within 3 feet of a BLE (bluetooth low energy) device. If Apple doesn’t want to create and manage their own payments app, they can process payments inside existing apps (like Starbucks), or using their newly announced App Extensions.

<div class=""section-inner layout-single-column"">
Apple can do this in three ways:

Apple Payments App — Apple can create its own Payments app that would process payments through TouchID and allow you to manage and view previous orders. Stores can connect to it through a BLE device and send the order and price details (like a regular receipt) and customers can pay through TouchID. The payments app can show up on the home screen when the user is within 3 feet of a device.
TouchID Payments API for apps — Allow apps themselves to process payments through iTunes and TouchID when the user is at a location and within 3 feet of a BLE device. The Starbucks wills how up on your home screen, you swipe up, and order details are there along with the store’s rewards and you tip and pay with your fingerprint. Personally, I think this is the most likely scenario to drive downloads of retailer’s apps and give them control. It would also further justify why they would let Apple charge a higher percentage than other payments solutions.
App Extensions — Just like Apple showed off yesterday, apps can now communicate with each other and you can load up a page of an app while you’re using another. I would expect Apple to treat iOS like an app and create a Payments App Extension that apps can create that will talk to the store’s BLE device and show receipt info on the device with the ability to pay.

This all requires a system on the retail side to identify who has paid and who gets the receipt. Using names/photos like Square’s recently defunct app can achieve this. Apple seems to be continuing to build the foundation to make this a reality, and the latest announcements show it.

Financing: A Tale of Three Companies - AlleyWatch,RezaC1,2014-06-05 13:16:08.805000,1,0,[u'RezaC1'],"If you want to start a company you might wonder where you will get the money your new business requires. The good news is that you have many options, as long as your business plan is sound and the market opportunity is big.
But, before we get to that, don’t confuse the money your business requires with the money you require to maintain your lifestyle – investors will not invest in you so you can pay your mortgage or make your car payments; investors invest in your company to get a return. So if you want to raise some capital you need to present them with a good investment opportunity that is likely to provide a return. It’s up to you to figure out how to cover your lifestyle expenses until you can pay yourself a decent salary, either through your savings or secondary income."

Take it back.” Today also marks the one year anniversary of the Edward Snowden leaks that showed the extent of the NSA data collection and surveillance activities. Reset The Net is meant to be a citizen and corporate response that uses technological means to thwart the NSA and other agencies like it. The basics of Reset the Net are indisputably good practices. Sites should use SSL to avoid session highjacking and eavesdropping. People should know that there are tools for encrypting private communications as well as tools for anonymizing their access to the web.
There are, however, two important ways in which we need to be careful about Reset the Net. First, technological means are not a substitute for political change including comprehensive reform of the NSA. As the heartbleed vulnerability showed and as Quinn Norton describes extensively in her post Everything is Broken, the complexity of existing systems is such that we cannot and should not rely on technology alone. There is a good chance that whatever system you are using has some kind of backdoor or exploitable flaw in it (and if it doesn’t today it might tomorrow as part of an upgrade).
Second, it would be a tragic loss if more and more of the net migrated into private, ephemeral and encrypted communications among small groups. Much of the net’s power to move us forward as a species comes from open collaboration and the potential of collective intelligence. Whether it is discovering great content from unknown writers or using patterns of queries to identify public health issues there are a myriad of ways we can all be better off when information is openly accessible. That is the fundamental promise of a network that connects every single human being on the planet and we should not lose sight of it.  "

Would love to get your feedback on two counts:
1) Adding more data: Will be great, if you think it makes sense to share this in the larger community what other patent holding firms & rampages we can add to this. We plan to add more data/research on this based on the community's feedback. Just some names of the patent holding firms, some lawsuits & URLs will be enough for us to do the digging & add to this.
2) Any ideas on how to represent the data of patent lawsuits against a disparate number of firms. Right now, we just have a simple bar chart but any other ways to better represent the data?

On the other hand, the fact that it's an auction reinforces the notion of bitcoins as property rather than currency. We need some legislation that recognizes it as legal tender. Can you imagine governments having bitcoin reserves?"

Career Lessons from a Pool Hustler Turned CEO,KolinaCicero,2014-06-13 10:12:18.525000,1,0,[u'KolinaCicero'],"Fred Cook, the CEO of PR juggernaut GolinHarris, has worked with Jeff Bezos, Michael Eisner, and Steve Jobs. You would expect him to have attended the best schools, gotten the best grades, and racked up marketable skills before he could legally vote. But the best thing about Fred is that none of those things are true.
As he describes in his new book Improvise: Unconventional Career Advice from an Unlikely CEO, Fred got to where he is through a diverse set of experiences that includes pool hustling, selling Italian leather on the streets of Florence, and getting arrested while working as a doorman at a five-star hotel. The career lessons he mastered at each stage of his colorful career became his credentials. Here are some of the highlights.
Lesson #1:  Learn to Play Pool
As a pool hustler, Fred spent most of his time huddled around Brunswick pool tables arranged geometrically on ornate floral carpeting speckled with 50,000 cigarette burns. To prove his prowess, he wielded a 19-ounce, inlayed Willie Hoppe pool cue that his parents gave him as a bribe for completing confirmation class. He learned to think of his life experiences as balls on a pool table. If there are only two, your shot options are limited. But when you have fifteen, the combinations are endless. Fred now works in a business of ideas, and he finds that his pool hustling career allows him to generate more than most people. It’s not that he’s smarter or more creative – he simply has more options to play with.
Lesson #2: Hang Out with Bums
At the Arc Lanes bowling alley, Fred was mentored by dropouts and derelicts with names like Red Dog, Baby Pod, and Fat Beckham, who were collectively known as the Arc Bums. The criteria for becoming a Bum included a high school diploma, no visible means of support, and time in jail or reform school. As a young person from the right side of the track, Fred was very different from this crowd – and that was what made the experience worthwhile. “Most of us like to hang out with people just like us, but that’s a problem because we never learn how to deal with other types of people,” he says. “If you’ve already assembled a cast of curious characters, learn from them. If you haven’t, move to Las Vegas.”
Lesson #3:  Escape from America
Fred was bitten by the travel bug early in life. He has flown 6 million miles and seen many places average Americans may never visit, like Burma, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. On those trips, Fred counted cars on country roads, peeled potatoes at summer camp, and tested escape ramps on airplanes. As a result, he feels comfortable in most every culture and any situation. He says that his time outside the U.S. is directly responsible for his success in it. If you want to compete in the global economy and do work that’s location independent, you have to see it for yourself and expose yourself to people with different perspectives and points of view. Sometimes you are going to get discriminated against because you’re an American or a certain ethnicity, but it’s important to be able to function anyway. After all, many people experience this every day of their lives and don’t use it as an excuse.
Lesson #4: Be Cliquey
When Fred was promoted to president of GolinHarris, he moved from the LA office where he was beloved, to the headquarters in Chicago where he was unknown. The day before he arrived, the senior people in the company lined up outside the CEO’s office to lobby against reporting to Fred. His first year was tough. He mostly worked alone on uninspiring projects and remembers asking one fellow senior leader when she could introduce him to her client. Her response was, “Why would I ever do that?” Fred built his relationships in Chicago little by little. He asked about his colleagues’ frustrations, ambitions, and personal lives. Gradually, they realized Fred was there to help them, not just himself, and more than 10 years later, he’s still working with the same team of executives. Fred found his entourage, and they all have each other’s backs. Whether we like it or not, humans are social beings and workplaces are cliquey. If you want to succeed at a new job or in a new position, you have to find your own.
Lesson #5: Get Arrested
As a doorman at a luxury hotel, Fred worked four nights a week in the congenial Southern California weather, checked in thousands of prestigious guests and parked hundreds of expensive cars. One night, however, he had a run in with the LAPD, whose cars were blocking his prime guests parking locations. When Fred hemmed in the police cars and threatened the security of the visiting mayor, he was arrested. Things could have turned very bad very quickly, but Fred was able to diffuse the situation and take away these gems about dealing with unreasonable people. First, don’t argue. No matter how right you are, trying to convince them they’re wrong just makes them angrier. Second, don’t take anything they say personally.
Third, listen. Most of the time, they aren’t looking for a solution. They just need to vent. If you let them, they will eventually calm down. Then you can apologize. “I’m sorry” is the most powerful phrase in the world.
What unconventional experiences are in your career past?  What did you learn that you couldn’t do without today?

"Intelligent Software Is The Future Of Application Delivery, Not Networking Centric Approaches",kidmercury,2014-06-18 10:43:12.735000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"
By moving to a “software-defined” model of application delivery, Instart Logic is designed to address the latest performance bottleneck – the wireless “last mile” from the cell tower or WiFi router to the device. The last mile is so painful for traditional CDNs because of four main variables including: network conditions and congestion, speed of Internet connection, application content and structure, and device type. One or any combination of the four can cause applications to load slowly or render a poor user experience. Instart Logic specifically designed its solution to take into account all four of these variables and use software-driven intelligence to address them for each specific user. This is their real secret sauce.

In the 20th Century, meaningful education was all about learning your ABCs. Today, it's centered on Alphas, Betas and C++.
Programming skills are becoming ever more important, quickly turning into the core competency for all kinds of 21st Century workers. That inescapable fact is leading individuals to seek out new ways of learning to code, startups and non-profits to find ways to help them and businesses to search for innovative approaches to finding the coders they so desperately need.
For the future in mobile technology,look into Africa.
Africa never had truly developed landline infrastructure, the continent “leapfrogged” the rich world in adopting mobile phones much faster than the rich world. Increasingly, most smartphone consumers are going to be outside the rich world. Already, the billion richest people on the planet have a smartphone. The story is now about the next billion, in the developing world—and the next billions after that.
You can help pioneer the future of technology in Africa by funding and supporting the first code academy in the continent.

5 months ago, my friends and I shared the beta version of our with the USV community. We received great encouragement and feedback from the dialogue in the comments.
To jog your memory, Shout is a community that enables people to exchange with those around them in a trusted and friendly environment. In our short life-span we have seen a wide-variety of exchanges (e.g., tickets, restaurant reservations, help moving, dog-walking, pranks, free cups of coffee, singing lessons).
In all honesty, a portion of the marketplace went a direction that was unintended. Since then, we have progressed tremendously and have taken steps to continue to build the platform we envision. For example, when someone Shouts, they make the binary decision between attaching a price or offering it up for free. We have also set maximum prices on certain categories.
We are building a community with a pay it forward mentality. Our team strongly believes we are creating a peer-to-peer platform that can facilitate spontaneous and extraordinary exchanges, hopefully, making the world just a bit smaller.
That is why I am reaching out again. This Friday (July 11th), Alexis Ohanian (a fellow member of the Shout community), will be offering office hours at a coffee shop in NYC. If you are interested, we would love for you to hop on Shout, grab coffee with Alexis, and send any and ALL feedback our way.
Thank you, USV Community."

"Taylor Swift, An Angel (Investor)- How I Think Taylor Swift can Really Change the Music Industry",Meshlakhani,2014-07-08 10:23:23.256000,3,1,"[u'Meshlakhani', u'aweissman', u'garychou']","Taylor Swift wrote an Op Ed in the Wall Street Journal last night about the Future of Music. It’s optimistic, and sweet, encompassing the love she puts into her lyrics (I’m listening to her right now on Spotify to channel her goodness). Taylor Swift has the credentials to speak about the music industry. She’s a multi platinum, Grammy Award winning, arena tour selling singer-songwriter with millions of Twitter & Instagram followers. She makes some very intelligent observations.

Piracy cannot be avoided- This is in reference to her fans recording her shows and putting them on Youtube. Swift responds by surprising her fans each night with guest stars.
She doesn’t agree with the argument that the album as an economic entity is dying. TS understands that piracy, file sharing and streaming have slowed down music sales, but she believes in the value of an album and that there’s a price for it. You just have to put your heart and soul into it and produce something that fans will cherish.

I think this is a great starting point for TS to make her opinions known to not only the music industry, but to the tech industry. She should use her voice to elaborate. How can we make albums valuable? How can we get fans more engaged? How can we merge the gap between music creators and the creators of the technology that distributes that music.
We know that tech and the music industry have their differences. Record Labels blame technology for the fall in music revenue (50% down in the last ten years). Music tech entrepreneurs find it very difficult to work with content holders. Investors are weary about investing in music startups because of how hard it is to get distribution rights, and when you do margins are slim to none. Record Labels are reluctant to support music startups because of further disruption or because they lack funding. Of course we’ve had successes, maybe not profitable, but amazing companies that have changed our listening experience. Spotify, IMHO, saved the the music industry from on going piracy and file sharing. Over 10 million people pay $9.99 per month to stream music. Streaming is 21% of current music industry revenue.
I call the decrease in music sales a market correction. Prices for albums were just too expensive, and music consumers don’t want that. They’ve made that clear by not buying as many albums as they used to. However, they’re still buying concert tickets and merchandise. Those prices haven’t changed. If anything we may be paying more for tickets because of the marketplaces that exist to facilitate supply and demand (Stubhub).
So what about the album? Taylor Swift acknowledges that it’s important to surprise her fans. Give them something they really want, and they’ll buy it. Can you create that within an album? Of course, if you look at an album as content and not just songs. We took a stab at this two years ago. A failed startup called Album Jacket. We believed that we could create value in digital albums by allowing artists to add additional and exclusive content to them. A platform to redefine the album and allow for album discovery through curation. We got some great attention, even from the labels, but we couldn’t raise money because we didn’t have any license deals (a model we chose). We couldn’t get license deals until we could show we had funding. I decided it was too hard to move forward and we closed up shop. I was warned of the pain of a music startup, but I was passionate.
Imagine how many other music startups failed because the founders quit or just ran into the same brick wall of licensing content. What if Taylor Swift invested and mentored entrepreneurs who were passionate about creating amazing music experiences that had to deal with industry she’s so familiar with? A Taylor Swift Syndicate on Angel List with all her other music pals investing $25,000- $100,000 into startups. I think that’s an interesting thought. Who better to make the right intros, give the right advice, and see if there’s product market fit (she can just ask her fans).
I don’t think I’ll do a music startup again, but I would love to see others try. Without them we wouldn’t have Spotify and Soundcloud. What I would really love to see are musicians like Taylor Swift back them. It’s just another form of fan engagement."

And communities can have great network dynamics, where they increase in value as participants join and share more. Union Square Ventures has a long history of funding these types of businesses.
These communities are mature on the web, but less so on mobile. And in a mobile-native, or “mobile-first”, world, some questions about communities arise, such as - what do these communities look like, how do they work, and how do they interoperate? Additionally, we’ve wondered out loud about how a mobile app developer competes in an environment where it feels like there is consolidation and maybe even market domination, where a few companies are concentrated at the top of the app leaderboards.
Then we met Amino (and Ben Anderson and Yin Wang, the founders behind it) -  a series of mobile-only apps each useful for a single niche interest community to share those specialized interests. Using the same technology platform, they’ve already launched communities for Whovians, Anime (Manga, Cosplay, Otaku, Vocaloid), K-Pop, Minecraft, and over 10 more. Each community is a separate app (iOS now, Android shortly), that collectively have been downloaded over 500,000 times. At the same time all the communities are networked together internally (which has real user benefits, such as single log in and deep linking across all the apps) and the platform itself is architected for easy and rapid deployment of new ones (the goal over time to have dozens, maybe even hundreds or more app communities).
This mobile architecture -  app constellations, if you will - is an important part of the Amino thesis: that for communities on mobile devices, hyper specific is of more value than general; that a series of apps is of more value than one; and that people are looking to build online relationships through the phone now, not just on the computer. We are pleased to be investing in them as part of their Series A round, along with Google Ventures, SV Angel, Box Group, Kal Vepuri and Slow Ventures.

So you have to drop the extra essay even if it is actually a good filter. How ironic."

marketing appropriate support can bit the world. More and more an online
shopping is becoming popular,differences in prices of the same goods in
different states are able to be huge( for example a certain dress in china
(alibaba) costs 9 $, the same dress in the online auction service centre in
Poland costs 100 $).Many persons don't want to buy these goods from china
becouse are afraid that goods (clothes) appropriately won't be fitting
them. Moreover a size isn't everything, buying dresses for the wedding this
dress must fit perfectly. So I invented applications, "" fits perfectly "".
The application will be to download to everyone smartfon.The user will do
photo, the program will count sizes of the user and will check whether
given clothes (T-shirt, dress, shoes) fit perfectly of the user size. The
program can be used also into other way. If you will be  interested we
can meet and talk, to discuss details of the cooperation.You have money, I
have a few interesting ideas on which it is possible earn much money.
What do you think about this app"

Just a Little Bit More Bitcoin Trouble,EllieAsksWhy,2014-07-18 12:58:05.884000,0,1,[],"There has been so much tumult in the bitcoin and crypto currency space over the past few days! Interest and concern extends far beyond arcane online communities. Motives vary.
Decentralized and anonymous
There are two conceptual pillars of trust that uphold bitcoin as being superior to fiat currency. The first is decentralization.
The fiat currency of reference is primarily the US dollar, for the time being. Why? Because the $US is the world’s reserve currency, for now. If Germany weren’t part of the EU, if Japan weren’t still in its lost decade and England weren’t so afflicted with problems, the DM, Yen or GBP would be attractive alternatives to the $US as a fungible, stable store of value.  
As ideological (not market!) confidence in the $US has diminished, the appeal of an apolitical, modern alternative increases. I won’t go off on a tangent as to why a currency printed by the U.S. Treasury in support of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy isn’t as highly esteemed as it was in the past. Obviously the $US dollar is a highly centralized currency.
The second conceptual pillar of bitcoin is anonymity. US dollars held as cash will be anonymous until one wants to use them for exchange for commercial transactions of size. Bitcoin has some anonymity short comings, but they are minor, usually.
Centralization of bitcoin
All markets are game theoretic. Bitcoin is more transparently so.  I really wish we could ask Professor John Nash what he thinks of bitcoin! Nash actually wrote a pleasant, accessible article about bitcoin-like currencies a few years ago.
I mention game theory because bitcoin’s most acute concern now is loss of decentralization. It is due to the documented, persistent existence of a 51% majority mining pool controlled by gHash.io. gHash is owned and operated by a private entity, cex.io. gHash’s market dominant behavior was noted in March 2014, but the situation was transient, unlike now.
Monopolists, and cartels, can assert control as a function of mining power. See How a mining monopoly can attack bitcoin for a chart of strategies that mining pools can pursue as a function of hash power. It was recommended by Ed Felten in his post, Bitcoin mining now dominated by one pool.
Production and transaction costs
In theory, bitcoin is a perfectly smooth, zero transaction cost medium of exchange. In reality. this is possible but involves a modicum of effort.
Some bitcoin miners and many non-mining users keep their holdings in custody of a clearinghouse such as Mt. Gox or Silk Road. This does generate small transaction costs, for holding the users’ e-wallets. In return, users benefit from the greater convenience in making purchases and sales. The clearinghouse may have an additional appeal to miners, as it offers the option of participating in a shared mining pool. 
Bitcoin was designed to reward early adopters; as more bitcoins are mined, more computational effort is required.
Mining Bitcoin requires processing power and electricity. In 2010, a PC with an NVIDIA or ATI GPU would have been adequate, but no longer. A new crypto currency-specific manufacturing industry has evolved for bitcoin mining equipment, using FPGAs which are more energy-efficient than graphics processing units. This was further improved by an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC),
In other words, a chip designed from the ground up for the specific purpose of mining bitcoins. ASIC also represents the theoretical limit on the hardware capabilities of mining equipment.
The mining rigs cost tens of thousands of dollars, and create a high barrier to entry for many miners. The remedy had been to use mining pools in the cloud e.g. Amazon AWS or clearinghouse hardware.
There are costs for miners, but a monetary levy is not the worst of it. The same can be said for non-miners who have others hold their e-wallets. Trust is equally important as middle-man costs. Mt. Gox “lost” many customers’ Bitcoins, then declared bankruptcy. No depositor funds have been recovered.
Electricity cost and externalities
Mining bitcoin is costly due to mining equipment prices and the high power requirements, which result in large amounts spent on electricity.
Perverse incentives motivate uneconomic choices. The most egregious and harmful behavior (directly associated with bitcoin mining) that I’ve seen to-date was unauthorized use of a National Science Foundation supported supercomputer to mine bitcoin. $150,000 in computing resources, e.g. electricity, were spent in order to mine the equivalent of $8000 in bitcoin.
Another incident occurred at Harvard University in March 2014. The researcher used Harvard’s high-powered network of thousands of CPU cores to mine an unspecified number of dogecoins.
I don’t know the significance of the following two abstracts to bitcoin or SSL. I would like to share this, in the hope of getting an informed assessment as to the relevance. On 15 March 2014, it was  “Ooh Aah… Just a Little Bit”: A small amount of side channel can go a long way:

We apply the FLUSH+RELOAD side channel attack based on cache hits/misses to extract a small amount of data from OpenSSL ECDSA signature requests. We then apply a “standard” lattice technique to extract the private key, but unlike previous attacks we are able to make use of the side-channel information from almost all of the observed executions. This means we obtain private key recovery by observing a relatively small number of executions, and by expending a relatively small amount of post-processing via lattice reduction. We demonstrate our analysis via experiments using the curve secp256k1 used in the Bitcoin protocol. In particular we show that with as little as 200 signatures we are able to achieve a reasonable level of success in recovering the secret key for a 256-bit curve…

Using the side-channel attack described, above, 200 signatures were sufficient to recover the secret key, as demonstrated using the encryption protocol (secp256k1) for bitcoin. Now, the authors claim to have refined their approach, thus reducing the number of signatures to 25, see Just a Little Bit More, by Joop van de Pol and Nigel P. Smart and Yuval Yarom via IACR eprint 2014/434 [PDF]

We extend the FLUSH+RELOAD side-channel attack of Benger et al. to extract a significantly larger number of bits of information per observed signature when using OpenSSL. This means that by observing only 25 signatures, we can recover secret keys of the secp256k1 curve, used in the Bitcoin protocol, with a probability greater than 50 percent. This is an order of magnitude improvement over the previously best known result. The new method of attack exploits two points: Unlike previous partial disclosure attacks we utilize all information obtained and not just that in the least significant or most significant bits… Furthermore, whereas previous works require direct information on ephemeral key bits, our attack utilizes the indirect information from the wNAF double and add chain.

Emphasis mine. Candid disclaimer: I have not read either paper.
Update
Nice Mr. Ok Turtles @taoeffect said it was a server side issue, not to worry.
For a more detailed understanding of bitcoin vulnerability, see Dispelling some myths about Bitcoin (serious). For an intuitive understanding of bitcoin cultural approaches to attack vulnerability remediation, see Novel method for backup of wallet seeds or private keys(not-so-serious).

Pictures connect to the billions in digital ad revenue. Partners function as an exchange with a goal to create cash incentives for the consumers to shop at the brick-and-mortars. The exchange also shares the ad revenue with media for digitally tagging pictures, which pays media on a pay-per-click system. Partners have one common goal to grow profits for the brick-and-mortar industry. Partners Shopping Apps is a platform for the brands, retailers, and consumers. Brands market their conceptual items and catalog of products. Retailers market their inventory of products. The consumers experience is being able to save pictures all over the internet from a PC, tablet, or mobile; vote on the brands conceptual items; buy direct from the brands with a drop shipment program to the retailers; and pre-order from the retailers at a discount rate.
 
Impressions linked to a proof-of-an in-store purchases, earn commissions based on a percentage of the sale. The commission is split in thirds with the platform, marketers, and the end users as cash back incentives. Connecting the pictures by data creates national ad campaigns from linking all businesses selling a product, to all the marketing pictures online showing the product. The data collected, sorted, and calculated from the Apps creates a market exchange, connecting once again by pictures all the retail buyers with all the brands. Orders will be grouped together and pricing will be negotiated on volume orders to assist small businesses with pricing. Creating equal pricing, between small businesses, big box stores, and Amazon. A logistics exchange will organize shipping orders through the retailer’s supply chain to lower cost through efficiency.
 
Online media will have the desire to be involved in the national ad campaigns with the ability to earn revenue. Pricing will be lowered from the top down with efficiency in market orders and logistics. The small businesses will receive lower cost with group buying from the market exchange. Then a third of all advertising revenue is placed back in the consumers hands as stimulus to lower cost!
 
The data from the exchanges is entered into a CRM and an accounting program will create for the consumer a ledger readout of their in-store purchases, similar to their credit card statement with two added subcategories. One subcategory list all products they purchased per store transaction and the other is the pictures saved with interactions. The data in the CRM will also inventory the worldwide retail supply chain and offer cost management tools to lower cost. This data will have the power to save jobs in retail industry, grow in-store sales, and create a rebirth of manufacturing in America. The data will show through ABC Accounting that products can be made in America at a lower delivered cost, then making them overseas."

Lets say your eye catches a few products from an ad like the above. This could be a tv/billboard/newspaper ad. Just try finding the exact same product on their site. Either you don't get the exact same product or you spend atleast 10 to 15mins to finding them.
One more problem is some ads provide really big links to the products which is really difficult to remember or even if you remember its difficult to type on small screens like mobile/ipad.
Help customers find your products easily.
Provide a uniform method of tracking how the ads are performing across traditional and digital media.

When was the last time you checked your business model?,xcopy_co,2014-07-29 08:23:44.532000,0,0,[],"Check Out http://xcopy.co/ GET STARTED NOW
here are several models are now common in the Internet:   One. Advertising revenue model   This is the original Internet model, based on the receipt of advertising revenue only; Advertising model is perhaps the best known. In this model, the site offers content, usually free of charge to the consumer. This can be in the form of news articles, blogs, or even services like Instant Messaging or search engine. The site includes ads, and as the site gets wider exposure over a given period, be able to charge advertisers larger amounts.   In fact everything needed for an online venture is to get as many users to your website or application, and will receive free services. Disadvantage in the model is the need to bring unusually large amount of users over time, in order to achieve significant revenue - a destination where only a few manage to stand.   Second. Affiliate model (Affiliate)   Affiliate model is one of the most common models and one of the least risky financially. The guiding principle of this model is the distribution of profits. Amazon is a good example of this model. While Amazon is a traditional dealer is also used as a link to buy products on the site known them, that Amazon serves as a partner site of the seller. Sellers usually offer a discount to buyers through affiliate sites and site partner will commission the link between buyer and seller.   The business model of rewarding affiliate commissions based on performance. Also commission and performance should be determined in advance. Examples of model: RevShare (distribution of profits), CPC (compensation by click), CPA (compensation by action / purchase) and more.   Three. Mediation model (Brokerage) Support by Xcopy   Brokerage business model is about creating platforms that from sellers to buyers. Hmonitiztzih is performed through a small commission clipping middle or on the basis of licenses. It is very important not to confuse this model to model partners. This is not about selling products but providing a platform. Examples of such platforms can be: eBay, Amazon, zap etc.   4th. Merchant model (Merchant) Support by Xcopy  Merchant model focuses on the production / sale, sending and organization of goods or services. It is basically an intuitive model arrived in the offline world. This model can be included vendors sell only digital products (such as iTunes) and retailers with an online presence in addition to regular stores. In addition, many businesses operating on the merchant model also will try to sell advertising space to generate additional revenue.   Five. Subscription model (Subscription) Support by Xcopy  Subscription model, user loyalty is a vital component. Users subscribe to a website Hmsfkshirot Msoimbtslum agreed Mrashal daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Subscription model deals with providing services or products on a regular and ongoing for some time. As part of this model can be taken to model the SaaS (Software-as-a-service), that is, software as a service. With the spread of cloud technologies has accelerated this model, this model gives the possibility to produce software and evaluate its software as a service on a subscription basis.   6th. Fee-per-use model Support by Xcopy  Model that allows customers to pay when performed using the product as an alternative to purchase a monthly subscription or perpetual license. This model is suitable for projects that allow payment by a specific service, for example, an enterprise that addresses technological questions; The customer pays for each question it asks only for data processing applications which are paid per processing and the like. Benefits similar to those of the SaaS model and offer more flexibility, but for the power it makes it difficult to forecast revenue model and building cash flow, especially at the initial stage.   7th. Community model Support by Xcopy  As well as subscription model underlying assumption in this model is user loyalty. Revenues may be based on selling products and services or voluntary contributions to help. Or income could be bound to sell premium services or ads. In this model, users not only loyal, but they also have a high emotional interest in the company. Wikipedia is one of the best-known examples of a web-based community model. Inherently suited to model the Internet community, and today is a prolific than ever with the growth of social networking. This model will be successful only when large community.   So, even if you have an idea that will attract millions of users application or technology will change the way the world does a specific task, remember that without the right business model suitable for all conditions and circumstances, not sure that the project bear fruit in economic and great success. Preliminary planning and flexibility to changing conditions are the basis for all, so it is necessary for success.

Over the last decade, we’ve seen the origination and maturation of these services, from Facebook to Twitter to Reddit to Tumblr to many more.
At the same time, we’ve wondered what lessons and use cases of these applications, particularly the primacy of their mobile sharing experiences, would spill over into other disciplines. And, when they did, what those new services and apps would look like.
For the past few years, USV has looked hard at how these examples might impact the healthcare system and sharing of medical knowledge. How, using the Internet network, you could connect every healthcare professional and by doing so, democratize access to medical knowledge. Human Dx, which USV invested in last winter, is attempting to do this through open machine learning.
Figure 1, a medical photo and information sharing app that allows health-care professionals to collaborate with and tap into their peers’ knowledge, is another. In a little over a year since this mobile-only service launched, over 125,000 medical professionals, including over 15% of all U.S. based medical students at over 100 medical schools, have have used the service or shared images, which have been viewed 100,000,000 times and commented on over 60,000 times. The company has already seen this result in the crowdsourced assistance of diagnosis of rare diseases.
This is an initial step in making the practice and learning of medicine into a more communal experience, by allowing medical professionals to share with their colleagues (and the world). One that we think will ultimately will be defined by a free, open access medical repository that any health care professional can contribute to and can comment on. Millions of assets, shared, collated and curated, by the greater medical community itself, via their mobile devices.
USV is pleased to announce that we are leading a Series A investment in Figure 1 today, joined by Rho Canada Ventures and Version One Ventures.  We look forward to helping this team grow a free, open access medical repository that any healthcare professional in the world can contribute to and learn from."

While we all agreed on the valuation and offer, we ultimately could not agree on the broker's invovlements and in the end opted to not sell the shares.
This brings up an issue with our current Employee Stock Option Valuation Model.  
Based on our current model, the options we will issue our employees will be worth $10,000 each.  (The company is still private.)
The inverstor offered a price over $31,000 per share.  They did perform their due diligence and dertermined this price to be the market value.
It was essentially a 6X multiple on our EBITDA, which I felt was fair since it was an institutional buy and not a strategic acquisition.
My concern is the ramification of the offer on my current valuation model.  Obviously, the employees will be upset that their shares were going to be valued at $31,000 post sale, but are now only $10,000 based on our model.
All the options are for preffered stock since our outstanding shares volume is extreamly low (less than 2,000 total).
I'd appreciate any insight you guys can offer.
 
Thanks,

I love this quote because it gets to the essence of investing.  The best traders and investors I know realize three things:

Emotion destroys
Patience saves
Losses happen

Markets are uncontrollable beasts.  Anyone that has tried to outsmart or outgun or outmaneuver the markets has usually been on the receiving end of a massive loss or a jail sentence.  The investors that survive and win take the disciplined approach."

Each notary chain has its own rules, and entries in these chains are constrained by those rules.

Uber taxi app banned throughout Germany after Frankfurt ruling,nickgrossman,2014-09-02 06:09:45.255000,1,0,[u'nickgrossman'],"
""Uber will be subjected fines of up to €250,000 (£198,000) if it defies the ban. The injunction was imposed after the German taxi lobby challenged the company for non-compliance with existing transport regulations.
Chairman of Taxi Deutschland said in a statement:

The Passenger Transport Act regulates the protection of drivers and consumers. That can't easily be overturned no matter how neoliberal the company.
Uber operates with billions in cash from Goldman Sachs and Google, wraps itself in a Startup-Look and sells itself as a New Economy saviour.

Because the court's ruling is a temporary injunction, Uber will have the opportunity to fight the ban in a follow-up hearing. Compared to the Frankfurt court, Transport for London (TfL) appears to be a model of laissez-faire. TfL has not taken any substantive action against Uber and back in July said as far as it was concerned the company was acting within the law.""

Generating value for shareholders is a possible result of a firm’s activities, not the goal.

Don’t Disempower Your Team
Do Promote A Transparent Scoreboard
Don’t Ignore Systemic Issues
Do Define Success
Don’t Make Critical Decisions Without Your Customer Team
Do Celebrate Customer Success

What Countries Allow Online Gambling,SamreenTayyaba,2014-09-17 05:14:44.361000,2,0,"[u'SamreenTayyaba', u'nickgrossman']","The world of internet gambling is strictly regulated and it is important to first be aware of what countries allow online gambling before you start. Online casinos have experienced a steady growth in popularity over the past few years, with more and more people registering with sites in order to enjoy their favorite casino games.
You will find a few countries around the world where this practice is legal and many of them house servers that are accessible to people residing in countries where it is not. This means that if you live in a country where gambling online is banned, you might still be able to play by dialing into a server that is hosted outside of your country.
The United States of America
It is true that more and more countries are realizing the benefits of legalizing internet gambling and are actively taking steps toward this. However, the law governing the prohibition of internet gambling in America is somewhat unclear. The estimate is that approximately 70 percent of US citizens make up the internet gambling population and suffer little consequences because of it. It may be that the situation is difficult to monitor and regulate because gambling online happens in the privacy of your home and not in the public eye.
Online Gambling Around The World
You can do a simple search online to find out what countries allow online gambling. The list below reflects a few of these where online gambling is legal:
Australia Belgium Canada France Germany Gibraltar Hungary Ireland Italy Liechtenstein Macau Malta New Zealand Panama Philippines Poland Russia Scandinavia Singapore Spain Switzerland Countries like Argentina, Mexico and a few Asian countries have all started the process of legalizing online gambling.
Enforcement and Regulation
Although the internet gambling industry is heavily regulated, experts admit that it is difficult to monitor because of its fairly anonymous nature. This poses a problem where online gambling is banned because it is virtually impossible to pinpoint players in the country who sign on from their homes. This begs the argument that why ban online gambling at all if it is so easily accessible and difficult to monitor? Regulation remains easier than prohibition in most cases and the trend seems to show that more and more countries are realizing this.
It is best to properly investigate what countries allow online gambling to ensure that you are on the right side of the law when enjoying your favorite casino games. This will also guarantee that you get to keep whatever winnings you make online."

I love words and I love phones. The forty-five minutes I spend each morning on my iPhone, flicking through my RSS and Twitter feeds while sipping coffee, is my happy place.
I'm amazed how much the will to exchange words on the internet has done for me. I met the co-founder of my previous employer, Appsfire, by commenting on his blog. I finagled interviews with three of my favorite people in the industry — analysts, nonetheless — for a post on GigaOm. My own blog, Whoops, has helped me to navigate my own thoughts about the industry, meet all kinds of interesting people, and prepare myself, unwittingly, for the occasion of applying to Union Square Ventures. I came across this job, of course, while sipping my morning coffee, reading AVC.
By way of background, I studied Cognitive Science at Vassar College. After a year in neuroscience research I moved into tech, having caught the bug after a (gleefully unsuccessful) mobile venture that failed late in college. I’ve lived the last five years in Tel Aviv, one of the best places on Earth if you’re young and in tech (not to mention the home of the woman who is now my [awesome] wife).
In returning to my hometown of New York, it's incredible to see how the city has flourished as a technology hub since I left (let alone the ways technology has since pervaded the everyday life of New Yorkers). Union Square Ventures has had much to do with that — both in terms of capital investment and thought leadership. It’s one of the many reasons that I’m so stoked to be able to help the team here continue its mission."

Asset Allocation in the Sharing Economy: The Future Balanced Portfolio,Meshlakhani,2014-09-22 08:41:05.933000,2,0,"[u'Meshlakhani', u'nickgrossman']","""You want a diversified portfolio? Ok, so let's call it 70% stocks, 30% fixed income. For stocks we'll diversify amongst a group index and mutual funds, include some growth in there. For fixed income, interest rates are basically at 0, so unless you want some high risk bonds, I'd suggest adding more to stocks. Commodities are getting hammered right now, but we'll get some exposure there as well. We'll target about 5% annual returns, and in 20 years, your capital will be significantly higher.""
Does that sound familiar? That's a traditional portfolio in a nutshell. It doesn't sound that exciting, does it? I recently came into these conversations as I took over our family portfolio and was in charge of two things: annual income to take care of costs, and growth of capital. I'm not saying it can't be done with public equities, but it's definitely challenging.
I think everyone should be exposed to the public market. I have a background in equity trading. Not only can you capture growth and income (through dividends), but you can always be liquid if need be. I'm also a startup entrepreneur, and I understand the returns (and risk) that can be made in investing in startups, both tech and consumer. I'm not an expert in this field so I choose to allocate to VC and Angel List Syndicates (more on that). And there's more to the private market than early stage investing. There are emerging platforms that allow for investors to receive quarterly and monthly income from real estate, small business loans and personal loans, with targeted returns of 8-12%.
This is a modern portfolio. There are plenty of people who have exposure to the private market because they are either investors, or they are successful entrepreneurs who understand the risk and now have deal flow. The same is true for public equity traders, who only have exposure to the public market. This modern portfolio is meant for the LP (Limited Partner): the person who has a high net worth (exceeding $1 million), or $200,000 a year job. These numbers are subject to the SEC's definition of an accredited investor. We hope in time that barriers to entry will be lowered, because it's simply not fair that the government determines who is financially ""responsible.""
I'll break down how we're looking at this. Keep in mind, I'm still figuring out the exact allocations of everything, but we're taking small bites and testing things out. Equity exposure is essential. We're allocated with an asset manager that focuses on families specifically. This fund concentrates more on our income needs, and it's a mix of index funds and mutual funds. We don't want to stop there so we diversify within equities. I'm looking at emerging traders/funds that concentrate on high volatility trading, pretty high risk. The key is understanding that risk, and allocating accordingly.Then there's a curated long term portfolio that looks at specific stocks and sector rotation. We use Howard Lindzon's Social Leverage 50 for this. The common theme here is that we've chosen people or funds that have specific skills, experience and solid track records.
Next up, bonds. This is so not sexy right now, and a lot of portfolios are limiting bond exposure because there's not much there. Sure you can get creative and go for higher risk, but I'd rather play debt another way: through emerging tech platforms. At the moment we are allocating into two platforms: Fundrise and Bond Street Marketplace Fund (both for accredited investors only). Fundrise is a crowdfunding real estate platform. One can sign up, look at open investments, and potentially invest capital (as debt or equity) into a property such as an apartment development project on H Street in Washington, DC. Developers are vetted, details are provided, risk is analyzed, and targeted returns vary from 8-12%, on terms anywhere from 12-48 months, paid out quarterly.The Bondstreet Marketplace is an online marketplace that connects creditworthy small businesses with investors looking to earn superior risk adjusted returns. Targeted returns are 8-12% on 1-3 year loan periods, paid out monthly. The most important thing between both of these companies is their team and their underwriting. I've sat down with both of them, and am very comfortable. Still, we've allocated a small amount to both to test and minimize risk at this stage.
Finally, exposure to private investment through Venture Capital and Angel investing. As of now, we can allocate up to 7-10% of our overall portfolio here. About 5% is allocated to a Micro VC (Red Swan Ventures)to get exposure to their Seed and Series A deals, along with their follow on investments. Love the team and the portfolio (legacy & current).The other half of our allocation will be a mix of Angel List Syndicates and Angel List Funds. We choose investors based on their track record,experience & transparency. I've been very impressed with how Jason Calacanis runs his Syndicate. He is so detailed in explaining each investment, and teaching us about risk exposure and diversification. We're also an investor in the FG Angel Syndicate Fund, which gives us exposure to 15 investments with one check. I believe there's a good mix of different strategies here, but time will tell what the right formula is (if there is one). VCs return capital as a fund, and can take up to 8 years (maybe more). Angel List Syndicates return on a deal by deal basis. There's been recent argument that charging carry deal by deal isn't ideal, but receiving capital back (if there's an exit) deal by deal is definitely appealing.
Overall, this is our start into how we can create a modern portfolio. It's a work in progress, and we've identified risk to keep our downside to a minimum- what we are willing to lose per allocation. I personally think this type of portfolio will transition into the mainstream. We want to be transparent, share our progress and open a discussion."

Here are the 7 Laws of Customer Success to help you get started in the right way:

Your Customer’s Initial Desire is to be Wildly Successful with your Product
The Natural Tendency of an unattended Customer is Towards Churn
Your Churn Rate is your Choice
All Customers are Not Created Equal
Traditional Relationship-based Loyalty Doesn’t Exist
It’s Not Customer Success’ Job to Make Customers Happy
There’s a Natural Retention Rate for you and it’s Not 100%

As Customer Success Evangelist for Gainsight, I have one goal; to get everyone to see the customer's success as your success."

Online payday loans company, Wonga, which pitched itself as a technology startup and attracted investment from multiple high profile tech investors, yesterday agreed to write off the loans of 330,000 customers, and waive the interest and fees for a further 45,000 — admitting its automated checks had failed to adequately assess affordability. The write off has cost Wonga some £220 million.
Wonga declined to detail the workings of its lending platform and how its algorithm was allowed to lend unsustainable loans to hundreds of thousands of customers, many of whom lacked disposable to pay back the loans or were already in debt to other pay-day loans firms.
A Wonga spokesman told TechCrunch it has a new interim decision-making process in place, as part of an agreement with new sector regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). “There are a series of wholesale changes — at the heart of it is much greater scrutiny of loan to income ratios,” they said.

New social network for pets,Petalbumnet,2014-05-12 15:55:48.094000,1,2,[u'Petalbumnet'],"Let me itroduce new social network for pets.
Everybody already know that the social media is a good place to share  pictures of your pets. In a world of social network for pets we decided to make petalbum .
One in 10 of all UK pets have their own Facebook page, Twitter account or YouTube channel, according to insurer PetPlan. A survey by DoggyLoot.com found that 14 per cent of dog owners maintain a Facebook page for their pet, whereas 6 per cent boast Twitter accounts. By contrast, one in every seven people on the planet has a Facebook account, according to research by Black Dog Studios, and an estimated 102,000,000 US Facebook users are pet owners and around 23m are considered to be non-human, such as animal profiles.
Petalbum is a new photo sharing network for pets that focuses on creating fun and interactive communication between pet owners.
Our user friendly interface is designed to make it easier for pet owners and animal lovers to connect over their favorite animals, Petalbum users share pictures of their favorite pets, fetch photo from web, tag on pin, put price on pin, put link on pin . Members can also choose between category like: pet sort, in memoriam, lost pets, pet fashion, animal protection, pet charity.
The Petalbum model combines the social networking features such photo-sharing and editing capabilities of Pinetrest (like creating boards and adding text to pictures). By being able to add text to the photos, users can share photos freely without worry that they may be passed along without proper credit, a common complaint on other photo-sharing sites.
Petalbum is responsive, because of that it works great on all mobile devices and tablets.
The Petalbum creators believes that Petalbum is perfect place for people who want to share their love for animals in specific place just for pets and animal lovers.
Petalbum  in one word ""all your pets pictures in one place"""

On reflection, we've decided it would be better to make that work public.  Starting today, we'll share more of our preliminary work on specific markets, industries, and technologies on USV.com. We hope it will be interesting and useful to you all, and we're looking forward to your feedback: what ""required reading"" did we miss? Which service must we try out? What conclusions have you drawn?   Our bias is toward openness, and we're glad when we can align our methods with our instincts. Blogging about our ""proprietary"" ideas and investment thesis has been personally satisfying and has helped Union Square Ventures. We expect publishing our research will yield similar outcomes.  First up is an overview of online education. The first section looks at whether web software can change students' outcomes and what sort of pedagogy could be appropriate for the internet. The second section overviews the higher education market in the United States. The third section includes information on efforts by American schools to link test scores and teacher performance.  The work led us to a few hypotheses:

We're skeptical a business model that charges for content will work at scale and in the long run.
We expect education platforms that offer vertical content and/or specific education experiences will be more successful than horizontal platforms, though we think credentials and careers offer two opportunities for horizontal aggregation
Without credentialing or careers, online education seems aspirational and removed from the day-to-day of many people.

Side Chains Are The Past Idea: Altcoin Distribution Per Bitcoin's Blockchain Is The Future,_trendspotter,2014-04-17 13:27:40.209000,1,3,[u'_trendspotter'],"Recently there was as an discussion about Side Chains. I don't think this where we are heading in the future. Altcoins with a distribution per Bitcoin's blockchain is the future. I tell you why.
 Bitcoin had a fair launch. Satoshi Nakamoto announced the launch of Bitcoin and then he started mining just like anyone else who believed in his idea. The core idea of Bitcoin is decentralization. The initial price of Bitcoin was 1 Satohi, or 0.00000001 Bitcoin. Bitcoin basically began at zero and everyone had the same fair chance.
Ethereum will launch like Mastercoin or Protoshares. The people with the most money will instantly become rich and will also be the largest holders and can manipulate the price by selling their large holdings.
Mastercoin had an IPO and the initial price per one Mastercoin was set to 0.01 BTC, just like the initial price of Protoshares. Some or many people in the Bitcoin community see this kind of launch as a scam and they don't support it. Every normal new altcoin launches like Bitcoin at a price of 0.00000001 BTC and then it's up to the people how much value they give to the new altcoin. IPOs hurt an altcoin. Since the IPO Mastercoin isn't doing so well in terms of price, every time I check it's falling. Protoshares are ultimately similar falling in price since IPO.
Ethereum will also launch like Mastercoin and ProtoShares. Meaning Ethereum will be instantly falsely labeled by many as a get rich quick scam. And people who will Google it will find and read scam accusations.
A better well thought out idea for a fair and codified initial distribution is æthereum as example. æthereum is a fork of Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum everyone can get some æthereum for free! How? Your bitcoin private keys will allow you to claim æther for free.
Fairness is where the future is."

Also not sure if the data takes into account in-app web usage when you click on a link on Facebook/Twitter.
Overall some good points though and well worth a read/discussion."

Groningen, October 15th, 2014. In the coming years, the technology behind crypto currencies such as Bitcoin will inevitably and radically change the role of traditional trusted parties such as banks, accountants, notaries, and governments. The animated video about Bitcoin that was released today on http://bitcoinproperly.org is the first to specifically address the technology behind Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Within five minutes, it is explained how the essential functions of the “trusted third party” can be automatized through the Blockchain as well as what the implications of this are.
From Bitcoin hype to Blockchain revolution: an internet of trust.
With the arrival of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, everyone around the world can trade with each other without any involvement from traditional third parties such as banks, notaries, accountants, and governments. Trade is a fundamental pillar of our economy and society, and traditional trusted parties play a crucial role in this.
The technology behind Bitcoin making all this possible – the Blockchain – ensures that the essential functions of the “trusted third party’, are fully automatized through the internet. This way, these functions are as freely available, accessible, and programmable as the internet itself.
The animated video, available in both Dutch and English, explains how this works, also mentioning practical applications. The implications are clear: in the coming years, the role of the traditional trusted parties will inevitably and drastically change, strongly impacting our daily lives.
The creators of this animated video invite its viewers to think about and discuss the fundamental and radical innovations made possible by crypto currencies.
Rutger van Zuidam ecommerce entrepreneur and founder of IntoBitcoin.com: “The Netherlands have all the assets to become Europe’s Silicon Valley of financial technology. It is possible for the Netherlands to position itself favourably in comparison to the US and UK, who are currently still ahead. The technology behind crypto currencies like Bitcoin plays an essential role in leveraging these opportunities. We hope that the animated video about the technology behind crypto currencies will positively affect this development, and of course we are ready for a more detailed, in depth explanation, exploration and dialogue.”
Lykle de Vries: ”Bitcoin is not the new money for internet,but it is the new internet for money, value and ownership in all forms. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are the next step in the emancipation of all world citizens, and can help create a new dynamic for democracy, society and economy.”

Encourage many people who had maybe only had fleeting thoughts about programming before might take the plunge.

Compare the page on Swift to http://developer.android.com/index.html and even http://rubyonrails.org/  you get an idea for the difference. Could turn out to have no impact in this area, though, I don't know.
The section on ""Universities that are incorporating Swift into their courses"" is important too. I've argued that the language and framework that college students are using should have a major bearing on which platform developers develop an affinity for, and therefore which platforms get the first and best apps. If Android doesn't come out with Go for Android or some equivalent there could be a pretty big gap between the onboarding of the two development platforms."

How Bitcoin Disrupts Payments,kidmercury,2014-10-31 20:34:40.683000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"Payments is always a price war. One might argue price it is the primary variable to success in every market segment one might participate in, but it's especially true in payments. If virtual currencies like Bitcoin are destined to win the payments game, they will need to have a strategy for competing on this variable.   Some will say they do, and it is because payments/transfers are free. Of course, they are only free if there is no need to factor in exchange rate. Obviously, they do.   So how could the exchange rate issue be eliminated? We could do that if we created an environment where there was no need to transfer out of a currency. Enough people accept that currency and there is enough stuff that you want to buy through them at a price that both parties (buyer and merchant) like so that no one is converting out of the currency.    Where are some places something like this could emerge?   Local -- where we spend most of our money, have recurring customers, and have lots of liquidity. Because of density, cities are great for this.   Online communities, where again you have the potential variables for a liquid economy.   Marketplaces -- online malls, of sorts. Amazon is the ultimate example.   From that genesis you have the foundation to build an economy. That is how virtual currencies create global prosperity, and give us the new world order we are destined to inherit. "

Google Donates More Money than Goldman Sachs to Political Campaigns,pointsnfigures,2014-11-03 07:58:54.381000,1,1,[u'pointsnfigures'],"Silicon Valley thought this was the year to fix patent law. President Obama backed reform. The House passed a bipartisan bill that would have raised legal burdens of proof and forced the losing party to reimburse the winner’s legal fees. This would have reduced the pressure on technology companies to settle, reducing the incentive for nuisance lawsuits. Reform seemed such a sure thing that Wired magazine in March crowned Mr. Obama “the great slayer of patent trolls.”
The trolls prevailed. In May the Senate Judiciary Committee was about to send patent reform for a vote by the full Senate when Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) shocked Silicon Valley lobbyists by declaring there would be no vote. “I have said all along that we needed broad bipartisan support to get the bill through the Senate,” Sen. Leahy said. “Regrettably, competing companies on both sides of this issue refused to come to agreement on how to achieve that goal.”"

These interactions alone provide the firm with an additional 5% increase in prescription revenue. To grasp the full range of effects, this means that for the top opinion leader, who influences 17 physicians, the researchers find a 35% increase in revenues. These metrics can then serve as an important input into the firm’s resource allocation and targeting practices. "

The Path to the Killer App for Virtual Reality,kidmercury,2014-11-04 12:22:04.619000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"I got Google #Cardboard recently. I found it exciting and encourage everyone to try it out.   A few more thoughts:  1. I’m wildly bullish on virtual reality. I believe the time is now and it will be huge. If there is one thing that can rival the currency revolution – currencies that arise from digital platforms – for magnitude of impact on the world it’s virtual reality. 
 2. The big obstacle to the first killer app for virtual reality is bandwidth.  Just as the Apple II won the PC revolution because it had the most capacity for memory to run the killer app of its time (Visicalc), so too will the winner of the virtual reality hardware battle be the one who can enable the bandwidth that the killer app needs. I believe this will depend largely on optimizing how hardware connects to the same type of hardware rather than a more “open” system, and may leverage other key technologies such as mesh networks or the blockchain to distribute the weight of transferring files. I do think virtual currencies and virtual realities are deeply connected, and thus I consider it reasonably probable that the same company will rise to dominate the value chains surrounding both of these key technologies. "

There are apps that need deep hooks into the OS (e.g. a podcast client that does audio transformations), and work better (or only) as native apps (though maybe the part of the app where you discover new podcasts could be a web view). And there are apps that work just fine as a web app, without anyone ever noticing the difference.
It’s fun to have ideological battles over platforms and technologies, but to developers, these are pragmatic choices, not religious ones. Some developers go with native apps, others pick web apps in native wrappers. As time goes on, I think there will be more and more of the latter. The only reason users should care either way is if they don’t want to be locked into a specific platform. And if they don’t, the slow, steady move towards web apps can only be a positive development.
Native apps are good for Apple and Google, but Apple’s and Google’s interests don’t always align with the interests of their users.

Why Hasn't Kinect Enabled VR to Cross the Chasm?,kidmercury,2014-11-07 14:29:27.184000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"In terms of product,  #Microsoft really nailed it with the #Kinect. They had a product that could easily have been the pioneer of virtual reality – what the iphone was to smartphone – but they didn’t pull it off. Some background on why it’s awesome:  1. The product is awesome. It had the foundation for creating 3D rooms, which I think will be huge: http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/14/clever-kinect-hack-brings-this-guys-full-body-into-virtual-reality/ 2. In addition to games, it had the compelling real world use cases that ooze disruptive innovation (i.e. opening up new markets that were previously inaccessible): http://www.virtual-reality-rehabilitation.com/a/virtual-reality/what-is-virtual-reality  So how come it’s not a huge hit?   1. Marketing. Clearly, #Microsoft has some product marketing issues. Hopefully the recent downsizing and reorganization fixes that, but until that gets solved, they will always have some very basic but incredibly important issues. The Kinect’s value proposition isn’t simple enough, what is isn’t clearly communicated, how to get it and install it isn’t simple enough either. Just inadequate product marketing all around.  2. Pricing and Positioning. They tried to promote a Kinect as a $500 gaming console. That’s too high of a price for too broad of a market. Maybe 3D game centers at entertainment venues would be better, or the specific industrial uses of Kinect. In other words, B2B rather than B2C.   Still, though, Microsoft has Kinect, a partnership including partial ownership of Facebook, and Skype. With Facebook comes the connection to #Oculus Rift. So maybe there’s still hope.  "

But great board members, with a lot of experience seeing companies get built, are the sort of people founders should want thinking about their companies every day.  There are a lot of roles where experience doesn’t matter in a startup, but board members usually aren’t one of them.  Board members are very useful in helping founders think big and hire executives.

But great board members, with a lot of experience seeing companies get built, are the sort of people founders should want thinking about their companies every day.  There are a lot of roles where experience doesn’t matter in a startup, but board members usually aren’t one of them.  Board members are very useful in helping founders think big and hire executives.

The decentralized public ledger is a new protocol that enables a fundamenatlly new class of systems: logically centralized but with decentralized control.
What does that mean? Logically centralized means everyone using the protocol agrees on what the state of the world is. For instance, imagine a list of usernames. Everyone agrees which names are on the list and which ones aren't. So ""logically"" it is as if the list of names were centralized, as if only a single copy of the list existed. Decentralized control, however, means that there is no entity (for profit or not for profit or even governmental) that controls which names are on the list. It is the protocol that handles that!
Today we are excited to announce that we are supporting the team at Onename in building the foundations for a decentralized identity and authentication system. The decentralized here refers to control. The Open Name System will not be under the control of anyone. Yet it is logically centralized in that everyone agrees on which usernames exist and who holds them. People could participate in this system individually or through delegates (think registrars).
Ryan and Muneeb have done a lot of work on enabling software which they are opensourcing so that others can start to build as well. They are looking for contributors, collaborators and team members as well as early adopters."

Project Beyond and Volvo Reality Illustrate VR as a Disruptive Technology,kidmercury,2014-11-14 23:30:05.869000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"Project Beyond and Volvo Reality Illustration VR as Disruptive Technology  First, there's Samsung's Project Beyond. The short story is that you put on a VR headset, and you get a VR view of a Project Beyond camera your VR headset is connected to. Imagine this for video conferencing, distance learning, and consulting, among many other things. http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/12/7205289/samsung-annonces-project-beyond-a-360-degree-3d-camera  Then there's Volvo Reality for Google Cardboard. This gives you a way to check out Volvo cars in 3D. Anytime you've had the experience of ""I don't trust buying it online because I need to see and feel it"" -- as many people do with cars -- you can think of this. Will the next big ecommerce player get started with using virtual reality to sell products/services that really need high tough? Amazon started with the ultimate low touch product -- books. Now, it knows it is unable to sell some things, paint being one example, simply because it cannot get the online experience right. Virtual reality could fill this void, and lead to disruptive theory playing out accordingly as a new model for distance commerce emerges. More on Volvo Reality: http://digiday.com/brands/volvo-becomes-first-automaker-use-google-cardboard-offers-test-drives-new-car/  It's clear to me that the ""smartphone + headset = VR"" model has some traction, though I'm still more enamored with the full body stuff Kinect is doing, just because I think it enables so much more. But I expect both models to co-exist. I still believe one of the biggest obstacles, if not the biggest obstacle, will be bandwidth. On some level, I think VR systems will rely on proprietary formats and smart devices doing a lot of work locally to reduce the amount of information that has to be transferred over the Internet. "

Today's largest networks have demonstrated this to be true. Passionate communities have been born out of services like Twitter and Meetup. Entire businesses have been built off – and on top of – companies like Kickstarter and Etsy.
It is almost impossible to measure the total impact created by large networks of engaged users. Platforms that enable individuals with different skill sets to collaborate enable innovation in a way that's only possible on the Internet. Github is a great example of such a platform. We believe Assembly is another one.
We are thrilled today to announce our investment in Assembly, a platform that pairs developers, designers, and other creatives with great ideas to collaborate on the development and launch of software businesses and applications. On Assembly, anyone can submit a concept for an app or software product, and the community gets behind the best ideas to build them. Contributors are stakeholders who own their fair share of the products, and the revenues they generate.
It's an entirely new way to design, develop and launch software projects, one that applies the values of Open Source to the founding of new businesses. Already, users from over 100 countries have come together to create products that have been used by over 4 million people. It's exciting to see what creators from all over the world have built, and will continue to build on Assembly. We are happy to welcome Matt and his team to our portfolio."

WebGL as a Disruptive Technology,kidmercury,2014-11-25 15:46:00.639000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"WebGL as a Disruptive Technology  The technology that excites me the most (not counting virtual currency, which I am excited about more because of its a sociological, commercial, and political implications rather than the technology) is virtual reality (I’ll use the term “virtual reality,” or “VR,” as a blanket term to encompass augmented reality, cinematic reality, 3D visualization, and that type of stuff in general). Most of the ideas I’m fascinated with (to the extent that I would like to pursue an entrepreneurial venture around) surrounding VR are capital intensive, which make them a non-starter for me. However, there is one area that seems to be very in my capital range (i.e. close to free) and still, I believe, exciting and filled with opportunity: WebGL.   #WebGL is a JavaScript API for 3D rendering in the browser. To put it simply, it makes creating VR in your browser very simple – essentially as simple as creating a web site. Of course, creating a web site can be a project that is fairly simple or inordinately complex, and WebGL enables quite a bit of sophistication as well.   The idea of VR in the web browser is not new, and historically it hasn’t worked very well. This leads many to believe it won’t work now as well. However, I think the appropriate parallel here is mobile computing, which is a technology that was around long before the iPhone. However, it wasn’t until the around the time of the iPhone in 2007 that capacitive touch screens became cheap enough.   Likewise, I think we are now at a major point in VR, in which graphics processing units are finally cheap enough, and frontend technologies (namely HTML 5) are finally robust enough  to make browser-based VR a reality.   So what kind of entrepreneurial opportunities does this enabling technology allow for? Put another way, what incumbents are at risk?  I think all the firms built on old school animation software are at risk. Granted, old school animation software is WAY better than what you are going to get out of WebGL. Of course, disruption is often about something crappy and cheap iterating until it shatters a paradigm, and I think we may have the genesis of that ready to foment. A grandiose vision might be that “the next Pixar” would be a firm that gets its start by developing expertise in WebGL, who finds a currently undiscovered set of customers that industry incumbents like Pixar are unable or unwilling (because of too little profits, presumably) to satisfy. This might be a WebGL animation studio that focuses on creating and curating short web animations, delivered and monetized via the web, mobile apps, VR headsets, special events, and who knows what else. "

Some analysts estimate there will be 9 billion connected devices, from parking meters to thermostats by 2018. By then, that will be roughly the number of smartphones, TVs, wearables and personal computers combined. There has been a lot less talk about how all those devices are going to be connected and almost no talk about the devices that don't stay put like drones, or sensors in cars will remain connected as they move around. 
Our newest portfolio company, Veniam, has been working on that problem for a long time. Their goal is to become the networking fabric for the Internet of Moving Things. 
Veniam's technology can be deployed in controlled spaces with many moving machines such as ports, airports, construction sites, and mines where it provides reliable and secure real-time data communication, creating new efficiencies in areas where cellular technology often does not work. But the real promise can be seen in Porto, Portugal where the companies technology was developed. There, Veniam has built the largest network of vehicles in the world, including the entire public bus fleet, garbage trucks, and taxis.
By connecting all of those vehicles, they were able to create a mesh network that turned every public bus into a WiFi hot spot. Today, after just a few months 72% of the riders in Porto with smartphones connect to the Internet on their commutes. To make this possible, Veniam created the necessary connection management, multi-hop mesh routing, session management, cloud-based control and security. 
Veniam will initially offer its technology to private companies and public institutions that own and operate large fleets of vehicles in urban environments. We believe, however, the company's mesh networking technology will ultimately do much more than create efficiencies for fleet owners. We expect Veniam to become a resilient, flexible, and cost effective alternative to cellular networks for connecting people and things on the go. We are excited to be along for the ride."

Platforms can be great (maybe even ideal) businesses - it's why the word platform is thrown around so much. It's an ideal because being a platform can mean a business that scales exponentiually with outside innovation and services. But at a certain level they are simple - to be a platform you must offer distribution and monetization. Apple/itunes store fits this precisely. Windows. Facebook has at certain points. Twitter as of now does not.
Platforms also often - and indeed must - change their rules. That's ok, as long as they offer some form of the distro/revenue model. it's inherent in the platform definition, and players of the platform need to recognize that (and generally they are ok with it - they are making $$ from the platform for some period of time).
But without distribution and monetization, a business is just a service. Nothing more, nothing less. As we talk about business models, that's all that matters to me.

Unique edges…,Designbookcom,2014-12-09 21:09:03.252000,1,0,[u'Designbookcom'],"The number of unique edges your crowdfunding campaign starts with is almost directly proportional to the number of backers you will achieve. Wow, so simple but so important! What are edges? In simple terms they are promoters generating organic content about your product… i.e. co-founders and vested collaborators.   • Edges are founders generating organic content • Promoters are “retweeters” and “likers” • Backers are those who give $ to your campaign  • Each unique edge equates to 100 backers  About a month ago I was a mentor at a crowdfunding “super huddle”. A well-dressed lady sat down across from me and said her campaign was failing miserably. She did everything right, she even selected a co-founder to help. As she went on she talked about her cofounder coming back home for thanksgiving, and I realized it was her daughter, in college, a unique edge, but substantially in the same social network. Contrast that with cofounders living on different coasts with only 5% overlap in their social network…  Realization: You need unique edges with diverse social networks… NOT JUST UNIQUE EDGES! (pivot, change definition…)   So how do we stack the deck for successful crowd funding campaigns? We crowdsource our team in advance of the crowdfunding campaign. Imagine a team that starts with one founder, he crowd sources a co-founder, not because he is his college roommate (and shares a social network), but rather because he shares the same passion and complements his skills. Then the two of them, through their diverse social networks, go on to add ten collaborators to the project, and they all hold equity position (aka have super motivation).   Here we go… you have 12 unique edges to start your campaign, you will likely pick up at least one super evangelist per collaborator and per the research 2000 backers will follow!   This is why Designbook.com is here… to crowdsource your team, create unique edges with diverse social networks and stack the deck for successful follow-on crowdfunding."

Web Services are different,BradUSV,2005-10-13 14:04:36,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"We are true believers in the potential of the web. Over the last year, we have seen a number of lightweight web services that could be the foundation for large and valuable businesses. Many of these services appear to be fundamentally changing the structure of their markets. This creates a tremendous opportunity for venture capital investors, but it also requires an appreciation for the very real differences between these opportunities, and the more “traditional” hardware and software opportunities that have been the bread and butter of the information technology venture capital business for the last 30 years.   Many of these web services reach customers directly through the internet rather than through channels; they are developed quickly and released early; they tend to be purpose built narrow services.Their value is in their usefulness not their comprehensiveness or their level of integration. Many of these services are “peer produced” - created by the same community of users that consume them. Because these services are often built on top of open source software, run on inexpensive and powerful hardware and delivered over the internet, they require a lot less capital. In the past, the differentiation and defensibility of an information technology business was usually based on the technical difficulty of solving the customer’s problem and the use of patents and copyrights to prevent competitors from replicating the solution. Today, with everyone building on top of the same tools, the differentiation is more subtle, and defensibility is more often based on authenticity of the brand, the loyalty of the community and/or the exclusive access to valuable data that is produced directly or indirectly by the web service.   It is easier to analyze an enterprise software opportunity. The business model is proven. The metrics are broadly understood. Unfortunately, if the growth is, as we suspect, going to be in web services, there is no way to avoid the heavy lifting required to understand the opportunity and develop an investment strategy that fits."
A Stray Thought on the Micro-chunking of Media,BradUSV,2006-05-02 14:30:05,1,0,[u'BradUSV'],"This is one of those blindingly obvious revelations that make you feel a little dumb in retrospect. It occurred to me over the weekend, as I leafed through the Economist's special section on new media that, it is impossible for a magazine that depends on wide circulation to efficiently deliver insights to a professional audience. I love the Economist for many reasons but when reading about a subject that I spend most of my waking hours thinking about, I found little that was new. But of course that would be true. Because the economics of the paper based media business dictate that they write for a broad audience, they inevitably frustrate anyone who is deeply immersed in a particular subject.   The corollary of that observation is that blogging and the micro-chunking of media are here to stay, at least as a means of communicating among professionals. Bloggers invite a dialogue with a much larger audience that they could ever interact with personally. But they are under no obligation to provide context for their musings or insights. They can just throw them out and let their audience self select. That means that posts can be small focused observations. The blogger themselves can efficiently extend their knowledge about subjects they already know well by posing pointed questions and inviting a response. For blog readers by using  tools like blog search, delicious and by navigating the link ecology of blogs, they can stay current and informed about narrow subjects they care deeply about.   The continued growth of blogs and of micro-chunked media is driven by the attention economics of a society populated, increasingly, by time starved, curious people looking for efficient ways to learn more about subjects they already think about every day. This does not suggest that mass media will go away. We all need to know about breaking news and general interest areas like art and science, and few of us have time to be expert in these areas. But it may make it difficult for specialized  industry publications to survive as a one way paper medium."

Anyone who owns shares or options in a private company instinctively knows that cap table management remains frustratingly analog. At USV, we own equity interests in more than 50 companies. For many of our portfolio companies we own three or more securities. The collection and management of this information is a thankless task but critical to our business.
Almost every company in our portfolio manages its cap table in a spreadsheet (Google, Numbers, Excel, etc) and communicates that information via email. At the end of each quarter, we have the fun job of nudging the busy management teams of our portfolio companies to provide a current cap table so we in turn can accurately report our ownership positions to our limited partners. The whole process feels like snail mail and is prone to error. Not to mention the process of collecting and storing stock certificates in a third party vault, even though no one except our funds could really offer these outmoded pieces of paper as evidence of a legally valid ownership position.
Of course, once a company goes public this information is all neatly arranged in a brokerage account. You don’t have to ping Google’s CFO or treasurer to confirm how many shares you own or calculate your fractional ownership position or try to triangulate a valuation. Why is that not the case with private companies? Why can’t investors log onto an account that has up to the minute information on our private ownership positions, as well as information on recent changes in 409A and other valuations?
Employees who own options have their own set of problems but have no interest or training in keeping track of option agreements, vesting schedules, 409A valuations, exercise mechanics, etc. This in turn places an unwanted burden on our portfolio companies and their law firms, and is unfair to employees.
Fortunately, a number of companies are bringing technology to bear on this problem. We think the leader in this space is eShares, which was founded by Henry Ward and Manu Kumar at K9 Ventures. On Friday, Henry authored a great post on the subject of broken cap tables: https://medium.com/@henrysward/broken-cap-tables-bbf84574a76a. In October, Andy Palmer, an early eShares investor, also wrote an excellent post from a user’s perspective: http://blog.koalab.com/2014/10/02/did-the-lawyer-lose-your-stock-certificate/
We are excited to announce that we recently led eShares’ Series A round, joined by our friends at Spark Capital and investors from eShares’ seed round. One of my New Year’s resolutions is to get most if not all of our portfolio companies to adopt eShares. Now that we have played with the eShares platform, we wish this had happened yesterday. More importantly, employee option holders of our portfolio companies will also be thrilled even though they don’t yet know how much they will benefit from the ease and transparency of eShares’ solution. Like many software and cloud technologies we now take for granted, we will soon wonder how we lived without it."

All posts currently on the homepage are > 3 days old. Thus I've hit the homepage and seen the same content 6+ times over 3 days. I understand USV not wanting to be a 'real-time' site but theres a long gap between real-time and snail-mail.
What is the USV.com use-case?
Is our goal for average visitors to hit the site at least once a day?
That seems like the most viable use-case and eminently achievable.
We want the site to have updated, insightful content and discussion. We want to become a habitual destination site, to do so we need to provide users fresh content, each time they visit (which we are estimating is at least once a day).
The same 10 posts being on the homepage day after day is a site killer. Will exhuast repeatt visitors and turn them away.
Who is our customer?
The once a week visitor or the engaged single/multi visit per day visitor?
Traditional wisdom is to play to your engaged audience. Appeal to your core. We're not doing that now.
 A fix could be as simple as making the default landing tab 'Latest' rather than 'Top' posts.
I'm interested in hearing whether other daily visitors feel the same, and whether they're coming to USV because they want to support the endevour or because they're gaining real benefit from it."

We just pushed an update to make our feed more comfortable to read and interact with. I love the idea of websites and apps being comfortable, a term I picked up from Jared Sinclair's post on designing the Unread app (iOS only).

Comfortable means always knowing where you are. It means not worrying about making a mistake. It means information has an obvious visual hierarchy: bold titles, tidy paragraphs, and spacious margins. Comfortable means there’s not visual clutter to distract you, except for those items that are supposed to stand out, like buttons. 

The update we pushed on January 1 introduced a few things on the front and back ends of this site. Nick's post about the update describe the primary goal we set out when planning the update: To give the most interesting posts and discussions on USV.com more time in the sun so that we could be sure everyone on USV.com was seeing really great stuff.
As Fred wrote in his post on AVC: ""I encouraged them to launch it and fix the inevitable bugs in public."" That's what we're doing with today's refresh. We've simplified the feed. We've also rejiggered the form for posting new stuff: now you can now just start typing a thought and then add a title or link later, if you want. 
All in all this update to USV.com might just be a new coat of paint, but it feels more comfortable to us. We hope it does for you too.

An idea about texting,libovness,2015-01-15 15:05:11.240000,8,30,"[u'libovness', u'aweissman', u'nickgrossman', u'pointsnfigures', u'staysmall', u'julien51', u'fredwilson', u'br_ttany']","I think many of us are quite convinced that in the not too distant future, messaging is going to mean a lot more than it does today. Benedict Evans certainly does, and we have plenty of evidence how much can be bundled inside a messaging app from the likes of WeChat, Line and TenCent in Asia.
It's not clear how all this will play out in markets outside Asia. There's some thought that one of the messengers will become the WeChat of the US. We'll send cash to people through one of these messengers, we'll book taxis and hotels through that messenger, etc. Will it be Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp? Or WeChat?
If, say, Facebook is planning to bundle all these services inside Facebook Messenger, it has a lot of bundling work to do (especially after it just spent all that effort unbundling Messenger from the Facebook app itself!). I can't quite put my finger on it, but I have a hard time believing that we'll see Facebook or anyone else could/would build such an app-store-like bundle on top of iOS or Android. 
I also believe that we're about to experience a wave of innovation around text. From Always bet on text: 

""Text is the most powerful, useful, effective communication technology ever, period."" 

And IMHO it could be a lot more powerful than the functions we're using it for today. There are a few companies doing very interesting things now around natural language processing. In fact Facebook just bought one of them. Path bought TalkTo. What's more, we now have years of experience with modern programming languages and hashtags and other mutations of everyday language, which hints at some kind API-like interface of future where we'll able to interact with apps just through natural language typing.
Here's an idea: What if Apple and/or Google enabled every app on the phone to interact with the user via text? In other words, what if you could text back and forth to your apps, wherever you are on your phone?

It's what people call an ""isomorphic"" app, which is a fancy way of saying that generally I don't have to think about the server or the client when writing code; it just works in both places. When we finally got JavaScript on the server, this is what everyone dreamed about, but until React there hasn't been a great way to realize this. 


...snip...snip... 


You might be wondering why this is so exciting, since we've been rendering complex pages statically from the server and hooking them up on the client-side for ages. The problem is that you used to have to write code completely separately, one file for the server and one for the client, even though your describing the same components/behaviors/what have you. That turns out to be a disaster for complex apps (hence the push for fully client-side apps that pull data from APIs).

I suspect that the second wave of online marketplaces will be characterized by the unbundling of the marketplace stack – payments, identity, reputation, listings, and so on – into a collection of open source protocols.
This is already happening in the deep web, as the environment is such that marketplace operators are incentivized to build even thinner layers between vendors and customers. 
What can we learn from these platforms?"

I suspect, even though Joel estimates the sale of illegal drugs is ten times larger than the next category of goods, that’s still a tiny fraction of the drugs sold on the street. The really interesting thing about Joel’s analysis is what it tells us about the future of open, transparent and legal markets on the Internet. 
By definition, these illegal markets are unregulated. There is no government agency you can complain to when you get ripped off. You cannot take a seller to court. You are entirely on your own. These markets are, therefore, some of the most free markets in the world. Because they are illegal, the marketplaces themselves have a strong incentive to use technology efficiently. They have to limit the amount of capital required, and the number of employees, so they may also be the leanest marketplaces in existence today. So what can we learn from them that might help us refine our approach to investing in legitimate markets?
I have worried for some time that as the value of marketplaces like AirBnB and Uber soars, they become vulnerable to a new breed of competitors. No matter how efficiently they use technology, they now have another mouth to feed - the shareholder. If Uber is valued at $40bn in the latest round and the new investors expect a 3X return, the company must somehow extract enough value out of the marketplace to justify a $120bn market capitalization. Yes, established marketplaces have strong network effects, but it is possible for buyers and sellers to use more than one app, and it seems likely that they will begin to move to apps that share more value with creators in the form of lower costs, and with consumers in the form of lower prices. 
It seems to me illicit markets on the dark web may offer a template for creating the next generation marketplace. At the end of his post, Joel summarizes what he found most interesting about these markets. He suggests their existence is proof it is possible to create and operate a lean, decentralized, market and lists the key requirements - low capital requirements, and an independent discovery mechanism and reputation system that spans multiple marketplaces. 
The illicit markets that Joel studied apparently not only decentralize control, they disaggregate functionality. Discovery and reputation are not the only service elements that are independent, it appears that these illicit marketplaces unbundle other services like escrow, and charge for them separately. As the Internet breaks down distribution bottlenecks, we see already see unbundling threatening to disrupt media markets like cable TV. Perhaps we are seeing a hint of what’s to come with legitimate, legal marketplaces, as network effects break down. 
Interestingly, the friction and latency, necessary in illegal markets to hide the identity of the participants, may not be necessary in open, transparent, legal markets. My first thought was, how cool, in a legal market you can leverage the design principles of the illegal markets but skip the overhead of encryption. But that may not be true. For a decentralized reputation system to work, you need some way of knowing that a review of a seller by a buyer is credible. The illicit markets do this by relying on the buyers private key to establish their identity. In existing legal markets, the platform manages identity and enforces the legitimacy of reviews. An existing network like Twitter or Facebook could create a truly independent and portable identity scheme if they were willing to give up collecting sensitive user data but they don’t seem to be going there. Even if you still need private keys to establish identity, you could still simplify user experience and reduce latency by eliminating the need to hide it. 
All this leaves me wondering not so much if the world will move toward decentralized, and disaggregated marketplaces, but when and why. Because the activities on the dark web are largely illegal, there is no other choice. For the rest of us, we are still generally willing to depend on a centralized platform for discovery, and identity management. For the moment, we are also still willing to accept the fees, the terms of service, and the bundling, these platforms enforce. My guess is the models pioneered on the dark web will come into the light first as leaner more efficient competitors to the first generation of peer economy companies, but the question I am still struggling with is where to look. Are there legal markets where the value of a decentralized market is greater so this transition will happen sooner, or will it happen first in any market where a first generation peer economy company goes too far by economically and politically disenfranchising the value creators at the edge of their network?"
Marketplace (related),falicon,2015-01-20 14:24:18.028000,0,0,[u'falicon'],"I think it's still all about lowering friction.
Payment is still full of friction and stopping points (bitcoin maybe)...trust is still full of friction (blockchain probably)...fulfillment/delivery is still full of friction (drones probably not; AI prob plays a big part of this though)...production [of physical goods] is still full of friction (probably the lowest hanging fruit here actually).
Advertising and marketing continue to be fairly costly and difficult (for most) and it appears this only continues to get more fragmented and specialized [funny how the initial big draw of the web was that it centralized and delivered focused eyeballs; making advertising easier and more cost effective; it has since swung all the way back]. Native advertising, and diminishing returns of ROI by almost all advertisers, just ads to this overall friction.
So far everything has been focused on and trending towards the 'ability' to have one-to-one conversations with anyone...next up comes the way more difficult challenge of making those 'quality' conversations and making sure everyone gets more out of them."

This whole discussion is an example of an exchange of value due to distribution costs being zero. (I'm on BART right now!). When transaction costs are zero, why not monetize this value somehow?

This would be an Uber including rides from Lyft and Hailo.  Or an AirBNB cross-listing hotels and Craigslist short-term rentals.
The marketplace's value-proposition shifts from ""just"" uniform, controlled, bundled services (payment, trust, reviews, uniformity), towards an always-trustable landscape that evidences specific opportunities where/when the platform deserves your business.
This will necessitate lower ""management"" fees and better/more substantial services to incentivize buyers/sellers to willfully join the platform.  ""Free Riders"" will enjoy no-cost distribution; so the quality of the in-house product/services, and overall experience will need to overcome that competition.
This model also means that these ""marketplaces"" initially resemble utilities, as they satisfy any individual user from the start.  Network effects build up over time as the supply of in-house buyers/sellers join.
I believe that such a marketplace model is possible without simply becoming an aggregator.  Amazon cross-lists lower prices, but many choose the (marginally) more expensive ""Prime"" option for peace of mind.  Craigslist could charge a small fee for every listing; instead, they monetize only the most competitive sections.
A specific example from my startup, Texts.com.  We provide a student textbook exchange without any fees/commissions; when there are no student deals, we earn affiliate fees through price-comparison.  We happily forgo potential commissions on student deals, as we'd rather differentiate and work towards becoming completely-defensible.  In time, we'll integrate open-source / royalty-free options to increasingly cannibalize our affiliate commissions and improve student trust.
We want a smaller piece of a bigger pie, which we can only bake through openness and competition.  I believe we'll see this trend grow as overall adoption increases, competition stiffens, and costs shrink."

However, I don't know how defendible that is in the long run.
Based on this assumption, one monetization source could be seller's placement and discoverability. I imagine marketplaces indexing and ranking sellers/products based on reputation (coming from different services rather than their own solely), and selling placement in the same way Google did with content in a decentralized network, launching Adwords on top. Besides the technology (which could also be commoditized), a large audience of buyers would be needed, referring again to product, user experience and distribution."

They will be eager to leverage this content (perhaps via blended learning) in their on campus and continuing education curriculum. Instructors and students are continuing to offer and take MOOCs in growing numbers. As more new courses cover the same or overlapping content and production values rise, we may start to see more options and choices that student learners have, and more ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in the course offerings.

Why Mark Cuban is Wrong About Startups and PR,ConradEgusa,2015-01-20 23:50:31.383000,2,0,"[u'ConradEgusa', u'nickgrossman']","When you’re Mark Cuban, everything you do is automatically newsworthy, and influential writers invariably pay attention. But most startups will not be able to dependably grab the interests of thought leaders, and even the ones that can have a broad array of potential announcements that aren’t significant enough to jump to the front of a news cycle. Disseminating those ideas and accomplishments is about extensive, repeated, and structured outreach stretched across days and even weeks.
Some entrepreneurs will decide they can handle that load in-house, but most would be better served by passing it off to a scalable third party service and concentrating their resources on other, more intellectually demanding pursuits. This gets closer to the heart of my argument, which is that entrepreneurs should think of PR the same way they think of anything else: in terms of cost-effective growth."

TEMPLATE
So, for startup marketplace opportunities, think about a ubiquitous/fundamental (non-marketplace) incumbent that would be 100X better if a marketplace were ""baked"" into it ---- so the new product will serve TWO FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSES: 1) the current purpose that the non-marketplace incumbent serves (ideally but not necessarily serving this first purpose far better than the incumbent), plus 2) interacting with the marketplace AND WITH A MARKETPLACE EXPERIENCE that's customized/integrated fluidly with purpose #1 --- so it won't look or feel like a ""marketplace 1.0"" product.
A PRIMER FOR APPLYING THIS TEMPLATE TO ENTERPRISE STARTUPS
oDesk covers many, many categories --- some of the MAJOR oDesk categories would be 100X better if the marketplace was baked into the parallel non-marketplace product THAT ORGANIZATION ARE ALREADY USING (so you get 1+1=3, and, the experience is consolidated into one product).  e.g.: ask yourself the question, when an organization hires a programmer, or, designer, or, salesperson, or whatever on oDesk, what are some of the most common non-marketplace enterprise products that are used as the organization is working with the freelancer?

Guiding Principles for Future Marketplaces,inanebanter,2015-01-21 15:46:58.155000,1,0,[u'inanebanter'],"The marketplaces of the future will look very different from the marketplaces of today. 
Most companies are currently focused on the demand generation side of the marketplace equation. That is logical because if you don’t have users looking for assistance (consumers looking for taxis, small businesses looking for programmers, etc) you won’t be able to get the critical mass needed to get your marketplace off the ground.
However too many marketplaces focus too much on the demand side and forget that it is the quality of the suppliers that will determine long term success. The big winners will be the companies that put the suppliers first and adhere to the following principles: Transparency, Low Fees, Flexible Pricing and Data Portability. 
Transparency
Users want to see information about suppliers: bios, social media profiles, pictures, user reviews, etc. Right now many marketplaces resort to presenting an opaque view of their suppliers in a misguided attempt to prevent users from taking transactions offline. They are intentionally subjugating their suppliers so they can enhance the value of their brand (and keep the money in their system), but they are missing out on the fact that the suppliers ARE the brand. 
Show your suppliers off by allowing them to interact directly with users and the quality will increase. Full transparency is also the only way to allow both sides of the marketplace to completely trust each other. In the future the protectionist tactics of the status quo will be exposed as more and more marketplaces adopt 100% transparency between their users and suppliers.
Low Fees (Transaction Rake)
The reason the rake amount matters is that with low fees you are able to attract high quality suppliers. If a supplier does $2,000 of transactions in a month they would earn $1,800 with a 10% rake, but only $1,400 with a 30% rake and that is a huge difference for the freelancers that make up the supply side of most marketplaces (for those of you that haven’t read it, Bill Gurley does a great job of illuminating the benefits of a low transaction fee for a marketplace in his blog post: A Rake Too Far). In addition to a low rake, what if you kept decreasing the transaction fee between a user and a supplier the more they conducted business together? That would strongly incent suppliers to continue working with users within the marketplace.
Future marketplaces will realize that setting an exorbitantly high rake is not the only way to make money. Some of them have already figured it out, Peter Frank’s post mentions my favorite example Craigslist and how they charge most users no fee, but only charge for the competitive sections of the marketplace. There are other ""in-game"" features marketplaces can adopt to make money: charge suppliers for premium access or featured listings (bold, highlighted, prime placements, etc.) and these are just a couple examples of what you can do in a marketplace that has sufficient transaction volume.
Flexible Pricing
Many marketplaces have adopted fixed rate pricing, but future winners will allow flexible pricing on both the user and supplier sides. For example, fixed rate pricing is very prevalent with many writing marketplaces: you pay X for 4 star quality content, Y for 5 star quality content and so on. That model pigeonholes suppliers into a fixed rate, when their true value to a user might be 3-5X more than the established rate. Even more damaging is that low quality suppliers may artificially get paid a premium for their work when they should be receiving 3-5X less than the established price. The only fix for this problem is to allow for flexible and dynamic pricing in a marketplace.
Allowing users to name their own price does come with another set of issues. For example in many marketplaces there is the “race to the bottom” issue where users post projects for low prices hoping to get work from low priced (and in many cases low quality) suppliers. This is a very real problem that prevents many high quality suppliers from ever joining the marketplace. A solution is to empower your suppliers by allowing them to offer their services or goods at the prices they are comfortable with (Etsy is a great example of suppliers setting their own prices in a thriving marketplace).
Data Portability
Suppliers that choose to work in a marketplace must be allowed to create public profiles and to port their data outside the system. Users also want to access data (for ordering, reporting, etc) that is typically locked up in a marketplace. Future marketplaces will create free and robust API’s to allow both users and suppliers to get to the data they should rightfully own."

The Race to Become the WeChat of the West,AnujAdhiya,2015-01-26 12:46:18.211000,1,2,[u'AnujAdhiya'],"If you say that to people in Silicon Valley, you’ll likely encounter this response: The WeChat model will never work in the West. In China, you have a newer internet user who’s coming online through their smartphone and looking for new services. When they bank or shop through WeChat, they aren’t switching services — they’re merely being educated on which services to use. Compare that to the West, where you have much more sophisticated consumers. We already shop at Amazon, bank at Chase, and book rides with Lyft. People in the West have already decided which services they want, and they aren’t going to switch because of a better integration with chat. The WeChat strategy, while great in the East, will never work in the West.
And that makes. Would you switch from Amazon to Walmart just because you can now Kik a pair of shoes to your friends? I doubt it, unless you’ve never shopped at either store before.
But here’s what Silicon Valley misses: those people that have never shopped at either store. Youth. Young consumers in the West are like all consumers in the East. They haven’t yet decided where to bank, where to shop, or what games to play. But they all chat."
What Spotify’s December Growth Tells Us About Pricing,AnujAdhiya,2015-01-26 13:11:15.686000,1,0,[u'AnujAdhiya'],"There are two short term and two long term drivers of Spotify’s December growth:
Long Term 1: Student plans – effective discount: 50%
Long Term 2: Family plans- effective discount: 50%
Short Term 3: Holiday gifting - effective discount: 100%
Short Term 4: Holiday 0.99 promotion – effective discount: 90%
Of all of those the 0.99 for 3 months holiday promotion had the biggest impact. There is an argument that customers acquired this way are effectively monetized trialists and it is highly likely a large share, perhaps even the majority, will not continue to pay after the promotion is ended. But that almost misses the point. What the surge in adoption at lower price points shows us is a purer measure of the demand curve for on demand subscriptions, without the distortion of the 9.99 price point. Of course 0.99 is not a feasible long term price point but 4.99 is, or perhaps more realistically for now, 7.99 is.
Some of those trialists will unsubscribe after 3 months, some will forget to unsubscribe and some will decide that 9.99 is actually pretty good value. The net effect for Spotify will be more subscribers than it would have had without the campaign."

On one hand you have the pure DAO which is decentrally owned and operated, and on the other hand you've got the traditional model of dividend participation. 
One key aspect to make this work is to nail the relationship between user actions and the value they effectively provide to the company. If decentralized ownership is just pegged to the core operations of a company, there's nothing creative there. But if the decentralized/community owners add a different kind of value that is additive to the core, then there's something there and that added value and reward can be variable. 
Basically, I think that governance, value and ownership are interrelated to make this happen. 
Governance: - do users have a say in the governance? Value: - what value is added by virtue of what actions? Ownership/Reward: - what do users gain when they participate?
There is a lot of innovation that can happen around these models. I was going to write a post on this. These are some of the initial thoughts.

The problem with current equity ownership in these networks is that there is a deep seated conflict between maximizing shareholder value being a good steward of your network. On the margin there will always be pressure to extract additional value from the network and give it to shareholders.
This is why I am such a fan of the Benefit Corporation. Here the company operating the network explicitly makes being a good steward of the network a pari passu goal with shareholder value. In that case it will not only be perfectly legitimate at the margin to give back to the network but shareholders will even have standing on this matter. Put differently, if shareholders felt that management was not supporting the network enough they could become ""activists"" on behalf of the network."

Say AirBnB's founders had a strong vision to build community ownership into the company structure as the base of a points program where consumers can earn miles. Then they would have determined that consumers are the ""who,"" earning is the ""how,"" and that already provides clarity on how to tackle the remaining unknowns.

Shows to me that despite building a coop is the tough option, it probably makes sense, and everything that makes sense ends up finding its route forward. We don't know yet how this route will look like, but we decided to try, and that's why we've built TheGoodData, a data co-op.
I've attached an article written in Ouishare magazine about ownership in internet businesses. I'll summarise here our way:
1. Legal structure. It is great to imagine networked autonomous organizations built around blockchain technology, and I buy into that. But at the end of the day you need to have a bank account, hire people, rent an office, etc and you need a recognized legal entity for that. We have chosen an old legal framework built in the UK in 1965 called Industrial and Provident Societies (IPS). Not ideal, but it complies with a couple of requirements that we had (#2 & #3)
2. Share ownership linked to consumption or production. If you are a user, you deserve one share. This share gives you the right to participate in company governance and profits. In our case it is not only fair, but it is also a way to increase data protection. Company (and its data) could only be bought if members (data owners) decide so. With IPS these shares should be fully paid, but we have decided to give them initially for free to lower barriers of adoption.
3. Financial shares. IPS allow issuing a separate set of shares for non-members with limited rights. Those right limitations and eventual valuation downside are frankly a question mark for me. It may well be that we don't raise any capital from financial investors whenever we look for it. There are co-ops that have raised funds among their members, paying them a dividend. The Phone Co-op, a UK telco operator has done so, paying 2% dividend.
4. Minimum financial requirements. While trying to prove market uptake we have built a structure with minimal burn-out rate: reusing open code, with no full time workers, etc. Mutual companies may not be able to compete with standard limited companies in terms of access to funds, so they will probably need to adapt their structure and development speed accordingly.
As said before, this is just one route. Happy to hear about other alternatives and learn from them.

Some of the key themes that emerge about the manner startups are trying to disrupt commercial banks in are:


Increasing access to information thereby allowing businesses to make better decisions (Creditera, Fundera, Indinero, Siftscience)


Reducing the friction businesses face in conducting activities where friction can be time or effort (Stripe, Standard Treasury) or offering a more superior experience (Square, LevelUp)


Lowering the fees/rates businesses have to pay by serving as a cheaper middle man made possible by the use of data (OnDeck, Square Capital) or peer to peer marketplaces (Funding Circle, AngelList)

However, as a (necessarily) open source project anyone could distribute a fork and remove or give preferences to different community members who use the new fork.  
The network protocol itself must be agnostic to forks, otherwise you lose the advantages of permissionless innovation and create a single point of failure in the founding development group.

Today's governments have all a top-down structure typical of industrial age organisations, where planning, distribution (or resources) and control were key needs.  The new networked world is made instead of communities of peers - a much more efficient model powered by the internet. 
As of today, however, all these communities are managed by a centralised agent (uber, airbnb, etc.) whose motive is naturally making profits. It might well be that this is only a temporary state - before we move to truly p2p/blockchain powered networks but that future is not here yet. 
The issue with ""private"" communities is that they can only exist as long as the central agents make sufficient money. In small countries, for examples, certain sharing economy companies simply don't exist since it would be non-economical for a local player and the market is not attractive enough for an international one.  In these cases the government, or local authority, might go in and run the service on behalf of the community - just as public railways ensured connections to remote areas. 
This is just an example, maybe old school and very European, of community owned applications, where ""community"" simply means public sector. Just as it was meant to be in the old days."

Can Perfectly Transparent Organizations Exist?,hymanroth,2015-01-27 17:14:17.667000,3,1,"[u'hymanroth', u'albertwenger', u'annelibby']","The numerous scandals in Europe regarding various co-cooperative (mutual) organizations show how unethical managers can take advantage of highly fractioned ownership bases. 
Many joint stock companies have at least one shareholder with a large stake in the company. Failing that, there are frequently institutional owners who often coordinate their activities. Either type of shareholder has both an incentive and the means to hold the executive accountable.
This inability to supervise the executive is one of the key problems facing community owned organizations with many owners.
These problems could certainly be mitigated if the operation of the organization was as transparent as possible. It would be much easier to spot and highlight unethical behavior if all personnel were obliged to operate out in the open. In effect, they would be preemptively shamed into regulating themselves.
So having (hopefully) established why transparency is important for the correct operation of community owned companies (apps), I now ask if perfectly transparent organizations are possible?
I've actually been pondering this issue for a while. It began whilst thinking about the problems surrounding soccer's governing body, FIFA. I wonderded whether FIFA could be run in a totally transparent manner. By this I mean that all decisions are made in public, and all documentation (contracts, invoices paid and received, etc) are also public. 
My starting point was open source software, which is organized to a large extent on these principles. Perhaps contrary to popular belief, the OSS community is not a happy clappy one. There have been some titanic battles within certain projects, sometimes leading to the equivalent of nuclear war: forking. Yet OSS flourishes in spite of, or perhaps, because of, the conflicts that are so openly played out.
I then asked myself whether an organization which competes commercially with others could operate in such a fashion? The answer could quite possibly be yes -- but only if all its competitors operated on the same principles. 
For example, USV is a famously open company, but it shares far from everything. Secrecy can be a very useful strategic tool.
So after this very brief analysis, I suspect that community owned apps/companies are not feasible. At least not those that are for profit. Such companies are by their very nature likely to have a very fragmented ownership, which is open to abuse by unethical management. By running the company in a completely transparent manner this risk would be mitigated, but in my view this advantage would be outweighed by the competitive disadvantage of not having any secrets."

There is the question of regulatory compliance:
That might be one of the most difficult problems. The legacy system does not align with innovative new possibilities. Some projects in the Crypto currency space simply ignore that fact and take risks, but to build a solid model inside the legal constraints is unfortunately very hard.


There is the question of whether the equity should be purchased or earned:
I think both models are possible to combine. 
We have explored a DAO model where the people who are contributing to our project (Bitsquare - P2P Fiat-BTC exchange) are earning equity (increase the value of the DAO ) and they are free to sell that equity in a private or open market (open markete might have legal constraints). That way people who cannot contribute due lack of time/skills can contribute with money. Selling earned equity can be used a sfunding model as well.


There is the question of who in the community should qualify for equity ownership:
I think the allocation of equity depends on the type of contribution. If it is earned form complex work (e.g. software development) I think human judgement derived from the voting power of the equity holders is the most efficient way. For contribution which might be more easy to get quantified by numbers an automated system should work as well. We are missing tools for building such constructs, but with Ethereum we will hopefully get those tools.


There is the question of how the equity would be held:
A dedicated App coin could be used. One example is Nushares where equity holders are the coin holders. So to create a crypto currency representing equity is a viable solution which has already many examples in the crypto space. There might be legal concerns, but technically and conceptually that should be one of the areas which is easiest to solve. 


How it would become liquid, and how all of this should be managed:
Like mentioned above there are already projects where equity is held and tradeable as crypto currencies. With Ethereum the creation and customization will become much easier.
Furthermore governance can be implemented as smart contracts. 


We tried to design such a model for Bitsquare, as I am convinced that a user-owned DAO is the best fit for an organisational form for platforms serving and benefitting from a wide user base.
Equity  can be represented by voting power, which indirectly represents ownership. Dividends could be paid out from the result of the votings if there is a revenue stream. Systems like Liquid democracy could improve the efficiency of voting (people who are not interested in voting can delegate to others).
An organsiation can increase its value with work (creation of value -> creation of money). Funding can be archieved by selling part of that earned equity. 
The problems why we did not continue with that model were:
1. The tools available are not very accessible (lot of effort, not easy to customize). Ethereum seems to be a solution for accessible and flexible tools to tailor DAOs in future.

Devil's Advocate: would monetary incentives break the community?,giffco,2015-01-27 22:44:46.718000,1,0,[u'giffco'],"Daniel Pink's book Drive made me question what motivates us, and how monetary incentives can distort human behavior and emotions.  I saw this first hand in the Second Life community, back when I was doing virtual worlds work with Electric Sheep. When we organized community missions/games with a monetary incentive, it actually made the whole thing less fun for participants.
The platforms Fred mentions all generate significant value from their participants, but then all businesses have generated wealth from their customers.  Until you get to the point of unwilling lock-in (a sad occurrence in enterprise software), the customers are getting significant value themselves.  And a stronger network isn't just about barriers to competition, it is also about increased value to the customers. So what are customers ""owed""? And does it distort our happiness and sense of value from a platform when we shift from getting value, to being ""owed""?
All this said, I think the notion of coming up with new economic and legal structures to enable upside for long-term participation is quite interesting.
If done right, perhaps it would help corporations think longer term rather than the short-term destructive impulses the ""maximize shareholder value"" school of business thought has wrought on the world.  Albert's note on B-corps is interesting, but I'd like to see other models emerge."

Although not strictly community owned, the example of Ushahidi in Kenya is very interesting.
It would have been interesting to hear some of the tech leaders who attended Davos last week exploring this type of thinking. Unease about tax arrangements, privacy and just general anti business feeling is building into a threat for some of the largest companies. Community approaches are surely a better way of dealing with these concerns than uncoordinated and ill informed regulation.
Perhaps countries like Israel or Sweden with a deeper history of community ownership will lead the way? Or maybe Ushahidi is a signpost for Africa to be the cradle of this idea."

Most peers might be perfectly happy to have someone else own and run a platform as long as they felt respected, valued, empowered and fairly compensated. If the network effects that create defensibility in the first generation peer economy companies turn out not to be forever, perhaps peer network platforms will naturally begin to return more value and autonomy to the creators and consumers who use the platform. 
Eventually market forces may lead to something like a distributed autonomous corporation - an economic and governance structure that is fair by design and is resilient in preserving that fairness in the face of external and internal change."

As a discretionary futures trader for many years I personally found the ability to remain focused on numerous markets day in day out extremely stressful and difficult. 
I realised before long that any type of day trading has to be broken down into rules, if you do not have rules to a system then you are simply trading from the 'gut'. Once I broke my systems down into rules I decided to learn how to program and automate the rules. This opened up a whole new investment world to me. 
The ability to program my systems meant I could quickly test trading ideas on backtested data. Moreover, any system I created could be tested on numerous different market (stocks, Forex, futures, bond etc. 
After programming my first system I never looked back. My robot can now trade flawlessly 100% automated. They can trade 24 hours a day and never make mistakes. The biggest advantage to automated systems trading is ability to trade 100s of markets. As a human trader I could barely focus on 5-6 markets at a time, this was seriously limiting my trading opportunities. 
So this is open discussion, are there any human traders left? Will all future traders be programmers? Can you compete in todays markets without programming knowledge?"

Sharing is an established practice, and dominates particular aspects of our life, such as within the family. By sharing and collectively consuming the household space of the home, family members establish a communal identity. 
When “sharing” is market-mediated — when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don’t know each other — it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to access someone else’s goods or services for a particular period of time. It is an economic exchange, and consumers are after utilitarian, rather than social, value."

This is normally the way consumer tech works - people have a vision a long time before the technology is really there to implement it (remember the Newton, or the Nokia 7560). 
Today it sometimes seems like things are the other way around. Want to make a connected door lock? Camera collar for your dog? Intelligent scale? Eye tracker? The electronic components all there, more or less off the shelf. The challenge is in the vision for what the product should be, what people would do with it and how you would take it to market.

Analogies from Urban Planning,libovness,2015-02-03 15:39:16.540000,2,2,"[u'libovness', u'nickgrossman']","I just listened to last week's episode of the EconTalk podcast. The topic this week was Private Cities, and a few ideas in the episode about urban planning and economics struck me as analogous to our discussion on decentralization:


Disney World is the prototypical silo. In 1967, the Florida State Legislature essentially ceded governance of Disney's 25,000 acre property over to the company. Even today Disney governs ""planning, zoning, building codes, water, waste disposal, airports, roads, fire fighting and prevention, utility services, and security"", making it one of the ""largest private governments in the United States"". It benefits from central planning, enabling services and a level of design that's typically only possible when brought about by a central author and only succeeds when that author has relatively good taste. It also suffers from central planning, as the lack of diversity results in the kind of sterile, controlled environment that is fundamentally different than the charming sorts of juxtaposition and even decay that we appreciate in urban environments. In many ways this is where we find ourselves with Facebook today: A private government that is exceedingly well planned, but also one that is sterile, lacking in diversity, and a nice place to visit but a bizarre place to live.  


Gurgaon, India, the subject of the paper which brought about this episode of the podcast, and Jamshedpur are private cities, or centrally planned platforms. These cities, founded and funded out of the blue by entrepreneurs, have thrived because they incentivized entrepreneurship and innovation. Yet while they've properly incentivized development of infrastructure within private property, they've insufficiently protected the commons, as private developers seek efficiency by dumping their waste on public, ungoverned property. There are parallels to today's internet: We own the data that we store on our own devices (i.e., our property) but we're subject to the worst of internet services — social experiments, surveillance and tracking — when we enter the public square on Facebook or Google. The paper that is the subject of the EconTalk episode suggests two solutions to this problem: 1) A benevolent public or co-operative government that legislates in the interest of the public good or 2) The extension of property rights such that anyone could negotiate services that occur on their own property.   


The beauty of New York City's grid above 14th Street represents the very best of what can happen when a government with no equity stake has the foresight to plan the platform:



In 1807, at a time when only the southern tip of Manhattan was urbanized and the population of New York City was just 85,000, the Common Council of the City of New York created a commission that laid out roads and public squares for the entire island (Angel, 2012). The commissioners planned for a sevenfold expansion, an expansion that would not occur for many decades (the population of the planned area would eventually number over two million).

As much as the internet has already changed the world, we're still in the 1807 New York of the internet. It's comforting, in a way, to imagine that if we have the foresight to plan the future before it's overrun by short-term economic incentives, we can build things as beautiful and diverse as a city like New York."

In that sense, medical robots performing surgical cuts would technically injure us – which is forbidden by Asimov’s First Law. Blumtritt is right: the meaning of injure is not easily measurable but depends on context and interpretation. This is where it starts to get complicated. Especially when we try to develop algorithms that implement this type of reasoning.
How would the algorithm determin the best outcome? That depends on how it judges and what data it uses. If its main criterion would be to harm as less people as possible, it would go for the first option. If the goal is to minimize casualties, it would do the same. If the algorithm’s goal is, however, to minimize the degree of penalty of its driver, it would go for option two.
And after all, should you as the driver be held liable for an accident? I am asking this, because you would have not taken any decision. The algorithm would have. Technically speaking, its programmer could be liable as well, because he ""taught"" the algorithm its rules.

Lots of other great stuff in this post, including another interesting idea:

Noller expresses another thought that I like very much: he proposes that we, as users, should be able to turn off personalized, algorithm-generated information and gain access to its unbiased, raw counterpart. For search engines, this could mean we could perhaps have a button that makes sure everybody who pushes it receives the same information.

Why we need an algorithm ethic,libovness,2015-02-04 08:43:00.469000,2,4,"[u'libovness', u'br_ttany']","
The simplest solution would be to make it obligatory to publish the algorithm's source code. Websites could also document their use of algorithms by publishing an acknowledgement on the site. This brings us directly to the second principle – control. It must be possible to disable algorithms.
The reader needs to activate non-personalised access to a website at all times. But as we know, an algorithm is only worth as much as the data with which it is supplied. So the data needs to be made transparent as well. All of this needs to be done in a format that is readable and easy to understand, which might turn out to be rather difficult for algorithms in source code.

There are algorithms talking to algorithms when that blog post winds up in a well-intentioned, yet green, leader's hands.  What floated to the top of Medium? Got Tweeted by someone with lots of followers? Posted at HN?
Where do wisdom and ethics shake hands? (Also at play in the current discussion about vaccines.)
My concern in this post: hashtag = ""management."""

The Rule of 40% For a Healthy SaaS Company,AnujAdhiya,2015-02-04 16:00:09.117000,1,0,[u'AnujAdhiya'],"The 40% rule is that your growth rate + your profit should add up to 40%. So, if you are growing at 20%, you should be generating a profit of 20%. If you are growing at 40%, you should be generating a 0% profit. If you are growing at 50%, you can lose 10%. If you are doing better than the 40% rule, that’s awesome."
A REDEF ORIGINAL: The Digital Future of TV Networks & The Original Series Crunch,ballmatthew,2015-02-04 18:27:13.847000,1,0,[u'ballmatthew'],"When we think of the future of TV – or more specifically, the digital future of network TV – we tend to think around key concepts: over-the-top and direct-to-consumer distribution, à la carte availability, dynamic ad insertion, data-driven green-lights and so on. Yet, what's always missing from this analysis is a more fundamental examination of what a digital network could actually be."
Upping the ante - Morality Questions: SELF DRIVING CARS,L1AD,2015-02-04 10:02:32.901000,9,28,"[u'L1AD', u'fredwilson', u'DragonI', u'mattamyers', u'ro_gupta', u'nickgrossman', u'libovness', u'donnawhite', u'br_ttany']","...let's fast forward a few years. 
Self Driving Cars are a reality. The car's software handles all aspects of driving and safety.
Whilst driving, the car senses an upcoming collision and immediately begins calculating mitigation options.
Based on it's calculations, the following outcomes are possible:

1/ Veer left - Driver is killed
2/Veer right - Pedestrians are killed

WTF!


Does the government enforce standardized protocols based on ulititarian principles?


Can the car manufacturer set protocols to maximise profits?


Can the driver pay a premium to override default protocols to ensure the car values his/her life over all others?


Do hackers materialise to illegally flash the car safety firmware?


Can the algorithm take into account age/health/tax-contributions/voting record/citizenship status of driver/pedestrians when making it's decision?


Will there be an automated high-frequency auction in bitcoin where min-bidder gets creamed?


This is a small fry moral dilemma to deal with when it comes to ethical algorithms

"FCC's Proposed Internet Rules Changes Little, No Real Impact On Interconnection or Choice - Dan Rayburn - StreamingMediaBlog.com",kidmercury,2015-02-05 09:58:18.018000,1,0,[u'kidmercury'],"FCC Chairman Wheeler released a fact sheet today that outlined the new rules he is proposing for the Internet, which falls far short of solving the main complaints we’ve heard about in the market for so long. Many think it’s a big win for consumers that the proposed laws will prohibit ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritization content on their network, yet to date, no ISP has been accused of doing this. It’s nice that these restrictions might be a law going forward, but it doesn’t do anything to address the complaints of what takes place outside the last mile, or all the debate around consumers wanting more choices for broadband services."
